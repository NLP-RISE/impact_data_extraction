20,"-Meteorological history-
On July 28, 2015, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began monitoring a tropical disturbance about 415 km(258 mi) north of Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands."
21,The system featured a developing low level circulation accompanied by deep convection.
22,"Moving generally west under the influence of a subtropical ridge, the disturbance gradually organized amid favorable environmental conditions."
23,"A tropical upper tropospheric trough(TUTT) cell enhanced upper-level outflow, offsetting the negative effects of moderate wind shear; high sea surface temperatures and ocean heat content provided ample energy for further development."
24,"At 14:30 UTC on July 29, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system."
25,"Several hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) began monitoring the system as a weak tropical depression; the agency began full advisories on the system at 00:00 UTC on July 30."
26,"The JTWC followed suit later that day, designating the system as Tropical Depression 13W. The cyclone achieved tropical storm intensity by 12:00 UTC, at which time it was assigned the name Soudelor, a title of legendary rulers in the Pohnpeian language."
27,A central dense overcast developed over the circulation center shortly thereafter.
28,Some structural degradation took place on July 31 owing to subsidence from a TUTT cell to the north.
29,"Following a retreat of the TUTT cell northward, Soudelor's convective structure improved with well-defined banding features wrapping into the circulation by August 1."
30,"The organizing storm, with a redeveloped central dense overcast, soon entered a region favoring rapid intensification, including low wind shear, sea surface temperatures of 31–32 °C(88–90 °F) and high ocean heat content."
31,"Therefore, the JMA upgraded Soudelor to a severe tropical storm by 18:00 UTC."
32,Rapid intensification ensued on August 2 as the storm approached the Northern Mariana Islands with both agencies classifying Soudelor as a typhoon.
33,"The typhoon developed an unusually small eye only 8 km(5.0 mi) in diameter, among the smallest ever observed in a tropical cyclone."
34,"At 14:54 UTC, Soudelor made landfall along the southern coast of Saipan."
35,"After undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, Soudelor continued rapid intensification, reaching peak intensity on August 3."
36,"The JMA estimated peak ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 215 km/h(134 mph) and a minimum central pressure of 900 hPa(27 inHg), while the JTWC estimated peak one-minute maximum sustained winds of 285 km/h(177 mph), classifying Soudelor as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon."
37,"Intensity leveled off thereafter, and after maintaining Category 5 intensity for 24 hours, Soudelor was downgraded to a Category 4 super typhoon late on August 4."
38,"On August 5, PAGASA reported that the Typhoon Soudelor entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility assigning the name Hanna."
39,Soudelor weakened further to a Category 2-equivalent typhoon and stayed at that intensity for a day.
40,"On August 7, the typhoon reintensified to reach a secondary peak as a Category 3-equivalent typhoon, and later that day, Typhoon Soudelor made landfall over Xiulin, Hualien in Taiwan at 20:40 UTC on August 7(04:40 TST on August 8), and it arrived in the Taiwan Strait from Taixi, Yunlin around 03:00 UTC(11:00 TST) on August 8."
41,"Around 14:10 UTC(22:10 CST) on the same day, Soudelor made landfall over Xiuyu District, Putian, Fujian in China as a Category 1-equivalent typhoon."
42,"Quickly degrading, Soudelor moved erratically northwest."
43,"24 hours after landfall, Soudelor was downgraded to a depression, before becoming extratropical six hours later The remnants re-looped eastward, before briefly re-attaining gale-force winds as it moved offshore near Yancheng, Jiangsu."
44,"The remnants were last noted on August 13, affecting Kyushu and Chūgoku region."
45,"-Impact-
--Mariana Islands--
Typhoon Soudelor passed directly over Saipan on August 2 as an intensifying Category 2 equivalent storm according to the JTWC, causing widespread damage on the island."
46,Post-storm damage surveys determined Soudelor to have been substantially stronger at landfall: a Category 4-equivalent with sustained winds of 215 km/h(134 mph) with gusts in excess of 260 km/h(160 mph).
47,The National Weather Service's anemometer at Saipan International Airport broke after recording a gust of 146 km/h(91 mph).
