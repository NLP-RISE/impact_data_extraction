0,"Hurricane Ike() was a powerful tropical cyclone that swept through portions of the Greater Antilles and Northern America in September 2008, wreaking havoc on infrastructure and agriculture, particularly in Cuba and Texas."
1,Ike took a similar track to the 1900 Galveston hurricane.
2,"The ninth tropical storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Ike developed from a tropical wave west of Cape Verde on September 1 and strengthened to a peak intensity as a Category 4 hurricane over the open waters of the central Atlantic on September 4 as it tracked westward."
3,Several fluctuations in strength occurred before Ike made landfall on eastern Cuba on September 8.
4,"The hurricane weakened prior to continuing into the Gulf of Mexico, but increased its intensity by the time of its final landfall in Galveston, Texas, on September 13 before becoming an extratropical storm on September 14."
5,"The remnants of Ike continued to track across the United States and into Canada, causing considerable damage inland, before dissipating on the next day."
6,Ike was blamed for at least 195 deaths.
7,"Of these deaths, 74 were in Haiti, which was already trying to recover from the impact of three storms(Fay, Gustav, and Hanna) that had made landfall the same year."
8,Seven people were killed in Cuba.
9,"In the United States, 113 people were reported killed, directly or indirectly, and 16 were still missing as of August 2011."
10,"Due to its immense size, Ike caused devastation from the Louisiana coastline all the way to the Kenedy County region near Corpus Christi, Texas."
11,"In addition, Ike caused flooding and significant damage along the Mississippi coastline and the Florida Panhandle."
12,"Damages from Ike in U.S. coastal and inland areas are estimated at $30 billion(2008 USD), with additional damage of $7.3 billion in Cuba, $200 million in the Bahamas, and $500 million in the Turks and Caicos, amounting to a total of at least $38 billion in damage."
13,"At the time, the hurricane was the second-costliest in United States history."
14,The search-and-rescue operation after Ike was the largest search-and-rescue operation in Texas history.
15,"-Meteorological history-
The origins of Hurricane Ike can be traced back to a well-defined tropical wave, first identified by the National Hurricane Center(NHC) just within the western coast of Africa on August 28."
16,"Despite the development of a low-pressure area associated with the wave and signs of organization within favorable conditions near the Cape Verde Islands, the system was only able to generate intermittent thunderstorm activity."
17,The broad low-pressure continued to track westward and was considered to have become sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on September 1.
18,"By this time the cyclone had tracked 780 miles(1,260 kilometers) west of Cape Verde."
19,"Although post-analysis indicated that the depression reached tropical storm strength at 12:00 UTC that day, operationally the NHC began issuing advisories on Ike three hours later, by which time the system had already gained numerous curved rainbands and well-established outflow."
20,"Over the next few hours, Ike developed additional rainbands, but failed to develop a centralized area of convection due to the presence of dry air to the storm's south and its location in an area with only marginally favorable sea surface temperatures."
21,These factors were also responsible for Ike's slow developmental trend that began after formation.
22,"Ike's gradual strengthening began to quicken early on September 3, with the strengthening of an intense rainband around the center of the storm."
23,"At roughly 15:00 UTC that day, microwave imaging indicated that a primordial eye was developing within the intensifying tropical storm."
24,"Tracking northwestward, the NHC upgraded Ike to hurricane status at 18:00 UTC based on objective satellite intensity estimates and the appearance of the eye on visible satellite imagery."
25,"During this time, Ike was centered 690 mi(1,110 km) east-northeast of the Leeward Islands and was tracking west-northwestward as a result of a weakened subtropical ridge to its northeast."
26,"Ike's placement in an area with virtually no wind shear allowed for the hurricane to undergo explosive intensification despite unfavorable upper-level winds to its north, reaching major hurricane strength six hours after its designation as a hurricane."
27,"At 06:00 UTC on September 4, Ike peaked with maximum sustained winds of 145 miles per hour(233 kilometers per hour) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935 millibars(27.6 inches of mercury), making the storm a Category 4 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale."
28,"After peaking in strength, a ridge of high pressure to the storm's west strengthened, causing Ike to track towards the southwest—a path unusual for the time of year."
29,"However, this track also brought the storm into an area of strong wind shear, causing the storm to become asymmetric in structure late on September 4 and weaken, briefly dropping below major hurricane status on September 6 while 150 miles(240 km) east of Grand Turk Island."
30,"Although wind shear abated and allowed for reintensification, Ike would fluctuate in strength over the next few days."
31,"After passing near the Turks and Caicos Islands, Ike made its first landfall on Inagua in the Bahamas at 13:00 UTC on September 7 with winds of 125 mph(201 km/h)."
32,"After passing over Inagua, the development of a double eyewall—a feature that usually denotes the beginning of an eyewall replacement cycle—slightly weakened Ike late on September 7."
33,"However, the hurricane was able to reintensify and reach Category 4 intensity for a final time before making landfall near Cabo Lucrecia on the coast of Holguín Province in Cuba by 00:00 UTC the next day."
34,"Although Ike remained well-defined for most of its crossing of eastern Cuba, the hurricane's core had become disrupted by the time it had reached the Caribbean Sea after spending a few hours over land."
35,"Over the next day, Ike tracked westward, paralleling the southern coast of Cuba without much intensification; at times the center of the hurricane was within 12 mi(19 km) of the island."
36,"At around 14:00 UTC on September 9, Ike made a second Cuban landfall, this time on Punta La Capitana in Pinar del Rio, with winds of 80 mph(130 km/h)."
37,"Roughly six hours later, the hurricane emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a slightly weakened system."
38,"Despite tracking back over water, Ike's prolonged interaction with Cuba had greatly disrupted the system's core, and instead of quickly strengthening and coalescing, the storm's wind field instead grew and only gradual intensification ensued."
39,"Due to the storm's comparatively small inner core and intensity of the outer rainbands, an eyewall replacement cycle took place, preventing Ike from rapidly intensifying."
40,"At around the same time, a high-pressure area strengthened to the hurricane's north, steering the cyclone further west than initially anticipated."
41,"Moving over the warm waters of the Loop Current, Ike reached a secondary minimum in barometric pressure on 00:00 UTC with an estimate of 944 mbar(27.9 inHg); though winds would continue to strengthen afterward, the storm's pressure would rise."
42,"By late on September 12, Ike had reached the western edge of the nearby high-pressure area and began to curve northward."
43,"The formation of an eye just prior to landfall resulted in a slight increase in winds, and at 0700 UTC on September 13, Ike made landfall on the northeast end of Galveston Island in Texas, with a minimum barometric pressure of 950 mbar(28 inHg) and sustained winds of 110 mph(180 km/h), making Ike a Category 2 hurricane."
44,"After tracking inland, Ike weakened as it sped northward and later northeastward, weakening to tropical storm status east of Palestine, Texas late on September 13 and later becoming a powerful extratropical cyclone on September 14 over the Ozarks."
45,"A more steady weakening phase ensued, and after tracking across southern Ontario and Quebec, the remnants of Ike were absorbed by another extratropical low near the St. Lawrence River, on September 15."
46,"-Preparations-

67,"At 8:19 pm(CDT) September 11, the National Weather Service in Houston/Galveston, Texas issued a strongly worded bulletin, regarding storm surge along the shoreline of Galveston Bay."
68,"The bulletin advised that residents living in single-family homes in some parts of coastal Texas faced ""certain death"" if they did not heed orders to evacuate."
69,Reports said as many as 40 percent of Galveston's citizens did not pay attention to the warnings.
70,"It was feared to be much the same in Port Arthur, and it was predicted that low-lying areas between Morgan City, Louisiana and Baffin Bay, Texas, particularly those areas east of Ike's projected eye landfall would experience the greatest damage from storm surges of up to 20 feet(6.1 m)."
71,"The price of gas increased in the expectation of damage to some of the numerous oil refineries along the South Texas coast, or at least delays in production from the oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico."

84,A few outlining islands suffered minor damage and no casualties were reported.
85,Overall damage from the Turks and Caicos and the Bahamas was estimated between $50 million and $200 million.
86,"--Haiti--
The outer bands of Ike caused additional flooding in Haiti, which was already devastated by Hanna and also hit hard by Fay and Gustav."
87,"The last bridge still standing into the city of Gonaïves was washed away, slowing relief in the community considerably and creating a deep humanitarian and food crisis in the hard-hit region."

106,"--United States--
Due to the intensity of the storm, Texas closed many of its chemical plants and oil refineries."
107,"Because much of the United States oil refining capacity is located in Texas, the closings caused a temporary increase in the prices of gasoline, home heating oil, and natural gas."
108,"Increases were particularly high in North Carolina, especially in the mountains, where average prices were as much as 60 cents higher than the national average."
109,"The closing of refineries so soon after Hurricane Gustav, and the time required to restart production, also resulted in shortages of gasoline in such places as the Carolinas and Tennessee, partly as a result of panic buying."
110,"113 direct and indirect deaths have been reported in the US, including 85 in Texas(18 direct), eight in Louisiana, one in Arkansas, two in Tennessee, one in Kentucky, seven in Indiana, four in Missouri, two in Illinois, two in Michigan, seven in Ohio and one in Pennsylvania."

leaving millions without power(estimates range from 2.8 million to 4.5 million customers)."
131,Grocery store shelves in the Houston area were empty for weeks in the aftermath of the storm.
132,"In Galveston, by 4 pm CDT(2100 UTC) on September 12, the rising storm surge began overtopping the 17 ft(5.2 m) Galveston Seawall, which faces the Gulf of Mexico; waves had been crashing along the seawall earlier, from 9 am CDT."
133,"Although Seawall Boulevard is elevated above the shoreline, many areas of town slope down behind the seawall to the lower elevation of Galveston Island."
134,"Even though there were advance evacuation plans, Mary Jo Naschke, spokesperson for the city of Galveston, estimated that(as of Friday morning) a quarter of the city's residents paid no attention to calls for them to evacuate, despite predictions that most of Galveston Island would suffer heavy flooding from storm tide."

136,"Widespread flooding included downtown Galveston: six feet(1.8 m) deep inside the Galveston County Courthouse, and the University of Texas Medical Branch, the primary hospital in Galveston county, was dealt significant damage due to flooding."
137,The wide-scale flooding caused failures to all the facilities systems and allowed mold to invade all the buildings.
138,Tourist attractions on the island suffered various degrees of damage.
139,"The Lone Star Flight Museum suffered massive damage, as the storm surge washed through the airport and hangars with about 8 feet(2.4 m) of water; however, Moody Gardens was built with storms in mind and was able to withstand the worst of the storm."
140,"In Houston, windows also broke in downtown buildings, including the 75-story JP Morgan Chase Tower, and Reliant Stadium lost part of its roof."
141,"As a result of the high wind and eyewall that passed directly through the city, power outages were a major problem."
142,Some residents were without electricity for over a month.
143,"Because the storm system moved rapidly and did not linger over Houston, flooding was not a major problem for most of the city, as it normally is in a storm event, as a result of the relatively flat topography."
144,"On Bolivar Peninsula, Texas, dozens of people were rescued as flood waters exceeded 12 feet(3.7 m) above sea level in advance of the hurricane."
145,"Many residents, some trapped by high water on the road at Rollover Pass and others elsewhere along Bolivar Peninsula were not rescued."
146,"The peninsula bore the brunt of Ike's right-front quadrant, historically the worst part of a hurricane, and experienced catastrophic damage with the worst being between Rollover Pass and Gilchrist, Texas – west of High Island."
147,Estimates of lost homes in the peninsula were around 80%.
148,The Southeast Texas communities of Bridge City on Sabine Lake and large areas of nearby Orange(80 miles or 130 kilometres from the center of landfall) were inundated by the storm surge which traveled as much as 16 miles(26 km) inland from the coast.
149,Bridge City mayor Kirk Roccaforte estimated that only about 14 homes(later updated to around two dozen) in the city were unaffected by the surge.
150,NASA's Johnson Space Center  suffered minor roof damage to Mission Control and minor cosmetic damage to some of its other buildings.
