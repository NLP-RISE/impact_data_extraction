0,"Typhoon Utor, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Labuyo,  was a powerful, deadly and destructive tropical cyclone that struck the Philippines and southern China in mid August 2013."
1,"Utor, contributed by United States and meaning squall line, was the 15th depression, the 2nd typhoon and the first super typhoon in the 2013 Pacific typhoon season."
2,"Utor started originating near Yap, tracking westwards in a favorable development, allowing the system to be better organized."
3,"All agencies upgraded the system as a depression soon after, with JTWC designating it as Tropical Depression 11W and PAGASA naming the depression as Labuyo."
4,"Continuing westwards, JMA named 11W as Utor as it continued to consolidate."
5,"Developing into a tropical storm on August 9, Utor soon underwent explosive intensification and became a Category 4 super typhoon within a half day."
6,"After making landfall over Casiguran, Aurora in Luzon late on August 11."
7,Utor lost its pin-hole eye after having its land interaction.
8,"The typhoon re-emerged in the South China Sea, and it ultimately made its second landfall over Yangxi County in China on August 14."
9,Utor downgraded into a depression on the next day as it moved slowly over Guangxi.
10,The remnant low later dissipated on August 18.
11,"-Meteorological history-
Early on August 8, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) reported that a tropical disturbance had developed north of Yap."
12,"During that day, the system moved westwards and consolidated within a favourable environment of weak vertical wind shear and strong outflow, which was enhanced by a TUTT Cell located to the northwest of the disturbance."
13,"As a result, the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA), JTWC and PAGASA upgraded the system to a tropical depression 11W north of Palau, with the latter naming it Labuyo as it approached the Philippine Area of Responsibility."
14,"During the next day, JTWC and JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, with the latter naming it as Utor(1311)."
15,"Shortly thereafter, Utor began undergoing explosive intensification, achieving typhoon status early on August 10, as an eye developed."
16,"On August 11, under the influence of low vertical wind shear, very favourable poleward and westward outflow, and warm sea surface temperature, Utor began to intensify more and formed a clear eye."
17,"At 12:00 UTC, Typhoon Utor attained peak intensity by the ten-minute maximum sustained winds reaching 105 knots(195 km/h, 120 mph) and the atmospheric pressure decreasing to 925 hPa(27.3 inHg)."
18,"The system became exceptionally symmetrical, as the convective bands had further deepened and wrapped tighter around a 13 nautical miles(24 km; 15 mi) pin-hole eye, prompting JTWC upgrading Utor to a super typhoon."
19,"Due to land interaction with Luzon, the pin-hole eye filled in quickly; as a result, JTWC downgraded Utor to a typhoon at 18:00 UTC."
20,"Tracking along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge to the north, Utor made landfall over northern Luzon around 19:00 UTC(03:00 PHT on August 12)."
21,"Owing to peaks of western Luzon, Utor significantly weakened as the deep convection became disorganised."
22,"Early on August 12, Utor arrived at the South China Sea, where the environment southwest of an anticyclone was favourable with diffluence aloft, light vertical wind shear and excellent radial outflow."
23,"Although a ragged eye had formed later that day, the typhoon did not restrengthen further when tracking along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge."
24,"On August 13, the eye of Utor had become well-defined on the visible satellite imagery, but the intensity and structure remained when the system was tracking northwestward."
25,"At 07:50 UTC(15:50 CST) on August 14, Utor made landfall over Yangxi County in Yangjiang, Guangdong, China as a minimal typhoon."
26,"At 12:00 UTC, JMA downgraded Utor to a severe tropical storm, shortly before JTWC issued a final warning to the rapidly weakening system due to land interaction."
27,"Later, Utor weakened into a tropical storm overland, and JMA downgraded the system into a tropical depression at noon on August 15."
28,"However, the remnants began tracking very slowly in Guangxi, until the tropical depression finally dissipated on August 18."
29,"-Preparations and impact-
--Philippines--
Ahead of Utor affecting the Philippines, PAGASA issued various tropical cyclone signals for Luzon and Visayas, including signal 3 for the provinces of Aurora and Isabela and signal 1 for Metro Manila."
