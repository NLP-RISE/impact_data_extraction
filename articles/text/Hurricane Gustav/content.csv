3,"It formed on the morning of August 25, 2008, about 260 miles(420 km) southeast of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and rapidly strengthened into a tropical storm that afternoon and into a hurricane early on August 26."
4,Later that day it made landfall near the Haitian town of Jacmel.
5,It inundated Jamaica and ravaged Western Cuba and then steadily moved across the Gulf of Mexico.
6,"Once into the Gulf, Gustav gradually weakened because of increased wind shear and dry air."
7,"It weakened to a Category 2 hurricane late on August 31, and remained at that intensity until landfall on the morning of September 1 near Cocodrie, Louisiana."
8,"Weakening continued, and Gustav weakened to a tropical storm that evening and to a tropical depression the next day as it meandered around the south-central US."

12,"-Meteorological history-
Gustav formed out of a tropical wave that had previously produced t-rain and squalls in the Lesser Antilles."
13,It developed well-defined curved bands and briefly exhibited an upper-level eye feature.
14,The NHC designated it Tropical Depression Seven and dispatched a hurricane hunter aircraft to investigate the system.
15,"At the time, the system had a well-defined outflow in all but the southeast and southwest quadrants,
and data from the hurricane-hunter aircraft confirmed that the tropical depression had strengthened into a tropical storm, which was soon designated Tropical Storm Gustav."
16,"A brief period of disorganization
proved to be temporary as a well-defined eye wall formed that same night."
17,"In the early hours of August 26, as the storm approached Haiti's southwestern peninsula,
another hurricane hunter aircraft confirmed what forecasters already suspected—that Gustav had strengthened into a hurricane with winds topping 90 mph(140 km/h)."
18,"Before reaching Haiti, its satellite presentation continued to intensify, a central dense overcast became more prominent,
and the minimum central pressure fell."
19,"Hurricane Gustav regained a pronounced eye as it made landfall on Haiti, with 75 mph(121 km/h) winds,
near the town of Jacmel."
20,As the hurricane moved over Haiti's mountainous terrain its circulation was disrupted and it lost a little strength.
21,"Although downgraded to a tropical storm, it still had a pronounced eye in its mid- and upper-level structures."
22,"Its outflow improved throughout the night of August 26,
and the system was not very disrupted when it moved back over water into the Gulf of Gonâve."
23,"However, the storm's movement slowed, and continued interaction with nearby Haiti, combined with the incursion of mid-level dry air from the northeast, resulted in further weakening during the day on August 27."
24,The storm began a west-southwesterly movement that brought it closer to Jamaica.
25,"On the morning of August 28 it was found that, overnight, Gustav had either reformed farther to the south or had moved farther to the south than previously thought."

32,"At 2235 UTC(6:35 PM Cuba Daylight Time), a weather station at Paso Real de San Diego recorded a wind gust of 184 knots(212 mph; 341 km/h), which at the time was the strongest wind gust from a tropical cyclone on record."
33,"By the early hours of August 31, Gustav entered the Gulf of Mexico with maximum sustained winds of 135 mph(217 km/h) and minimum central pressure of 958 millibars."
34,"During August 31, the storm moved in a northwest direction slightly losing its strength(despite passing over a shortened Loop Current) with sustained winds at 115 mph."
35,"On the evening of August 31, Gustav weakened to a Category 2 hurricane and remained at such intensity until landfall in the U.S. Gustav made landfall along the Louisiana coast with 105 mph(169 km/h) winds near Cocodrie, at about 9:30 a.m CDT(1430 UTC)."
36,"At U.S. landfall, hurricane-force winds extended outward 70 miles(110 km) from the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extended 200 miles(320 km)."
37,"That night, by 10 pm CDT, Gustav had been downgraded to a Tropical Storm with winds of 60 mph(97 km/h) about 20 miles(32 km) southwest of Alexandria, Louisiana and by 4 am CDT on September 2 Gustav had diminished to a Tropical Depression with a threat of severe flooding in the lower Mississippi Valley and eastern Texas."
