1,"Forming northeast of Taiwan on January 13 and absorbing Tropical Depression Bising soon afterward, the storm quickly intensified in the southern sea off Japan on January 14, and reached its peak intensity east of Japan on January 15, with its central atmospheric pressure decreasing to 936 hPa(27.6 inHg)."
2,"The system then weakened, crossed the Kamchatka Peninsula late on January 18, and dissipated east of Hokkaido on January 21."
3,"-Meteorological history-
At 0000 UTC on January 13, an extratropical cyclone formed northeast of Taiwan, and the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) started to issue storm warnings on the developing low; 18 hours later, the storm southeast of Kyushu absorbed Tropical Depression Bising which formed near the Philippines."

5,"Late the same day, the estimated 10-minute maximum sustained winds reached 80 knots(150 km/h) when the storm was east of the T≈çhoku region."
6,"On January 15, the atmospheric pressure of the powerful extratropical cyclone far east of Hokkaido decreased to 936 hPa(27.6 inHg), which is equivalent to a very strong typhoon."
7,"At 0000 UTC on January 16, the extratropical cyclone started to weaken, and the storm was no longer producing sustained hurricane-force winds."
8,"A half of day later, the estimated 10-minute maximum sustained winds weakened to 50 knots(93 km/h) when the system was located southeast of the Kamchatka Peninsula, whilst the atmospheric pressure also decreased to 948 hPa(28.0 inHg)."
9,"The storm turned westerly on January 17, and it became gale-force at 00Z on January 18."
10,"Late on January 18, the center crossed the southernmost point of the Kamchatka Peninsula and arrived at the Sea of Okhotsk, when the atmospheric pressure was 986 hPa(29.1 inHg)."
11,"The low turned southwesterly then southerly, and it passed through the Kuril Islands on January 20."
