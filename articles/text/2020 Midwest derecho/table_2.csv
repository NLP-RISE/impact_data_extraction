0,1445,8:19,"South Dakota (SE), Nebraska (NE), Iowa (NW)",Issuing: SVA #424,"""Multiple clusters of thunderstorms have developed in the past hour across southern South Dakota and northeast NE.""...""Ample CAPE is indicated in forecast soundings over this region, along with steep midlevel lapse rates and sufficient deep-layer shear for convective organization. Isolated instances of hail are the primary threat for now. However, CAM solutions [Convective Allowing Models] have suggested the potential for one or more of the clusters to grow upscale and become a bowing complex later this morning. If this trend begins to unfold, a WW may be needed to cover the downstream threat.""",[157]
1,1447,12:46,"Nebraska (NE/E), Iowa (NW/W), South Dakota (far SE)",Concerning: SVA #424,"""Recent KFSD radar imagery shows the outflow outrunning the northern portion of the line in far southeast SD and adjacent far northeast NE. Additionally, the structure consistent with warm-air advection over a boundary, suggesting little organization in this area of the line as well. In between (roughly over Cedar, Wayne, and Dixon counties in NE) some better organization and faster forward storm motion has been noted. While likely still slightly elevated, this portion of the line currently poses the highest potential to produce damaging wind gusts. Recent storm motion of 45 kt takes this portion of the line to the NE/IA border around 8 am...""",[158]

""...the threat for severe/damaging wind gusts is expected to increase across parts of western/central IA. and a new Severe Thunderstorm Watch downstream is likely soon.""",[159]
3,1449,14:45,Iowa (Central),Concerning: SVA #425,"""Numerous measured severe wind gusts have been observed across eastern NE and western IA over the past hour in association with a small MCS. As this bow moves quickly eastward (around 45-50 kt) into central IA this morning, it will encounter an increasingly unstable airmass. A focused corridor of severe/damaging winds of 60-70+ mph appears likely given recent radar trends...""",[160]
4,1450,15:42,"Iowa (NE/E), Wisconsin (S), Illinois (N/C), Missouri (far NE)",Issuing: PDS SVA #426,"""A compact MCS moving into central IA as of 1540z (10:40 am CDT) has recently produced numerous severe/damaging wind gusts. Recent radar trends suggest this system has already become very well organized, with the development of an 80-100+ kt rear-inflow jet only a couple thousand feet off the surface per KDMX velocity data. The airmass downstream of this MCS into eastern IA, southern WI, and northern/central IL is already quite unstable, with MLCAPE of 2000-2500 J/kg present per 15z (10 am CDT) mesoanalysis estimates. Additional dinural heating of this airmass is expected to yield very strong to potentially extreme instability by this afternoon, with MLCAPE potentially reaching the 3500-5500 J/kg range by peak heating.""...""The forecast combination of very strong to extreme instability with adequate deep-layer shear downstream of the ongoing MCS strongly suggests that a swath of potentially significant severe wind gusts of 75+ mph is becoming increasingly likely this afternoon across parts of these areas. A new Severe Thunderstorm Watch will be needed downstream of the current watch in central IA [SVA #425] within the next hour or two. An upgrade to Moderate Risk for numerous significant severe/damaging wind gusts will be issued with the 1630z (11:30 am CDT) update of the Day 1 Convective Outlook."" (See update here)",[161]
5,1451,16:00,Iowa (Central),Concerning: SVA #425,"""Latest velocity data from the KDMX radar shows an impressive significant wind signature with the ongoing MCS, with 80-115 kt inbound velocities noted only 500-1000 ft above ground level (AGL). These very likely severe winds will move across the Des Moines metro area shortly, and they will be capable of producing widespread, destructive damaging winds of 70-80+ mph as the MCS races eastward at 50-60 kt.""",[162]
6,1452,17:14,"Iowa (C/E), Illinois (NW)","Concerning: SVA #425, #426","""...the apex of the bow is moving eastward around 55-60 kt, and the potential for widespread damaging winds remains apparent. A recent measured severe wind gusts of 99 mph was reported at the Marshalltown ASOS associated with this bow, and a couple other gusts up to 100 mph have also been noted. Current expectations are for this bow echo to maintain its intensity across eastern IA...A swath of 70-100+ mph wind gusts producing destructive damage appears likely to impact the Cedar Rapids / Iowa City area within the next hour, eventually reaching the Quad Cities area around 1:00-1:30 pm.""",[163]
7,1453,17:44,"Wisconsin (E), Michigan (Upper Peninsula)",Issuing: SVA #427,"""Visible satellite shows some clearing occurring across parts of central Wisconsin, allowing for some diabatic heating and temperatures into the mid 80s F with dew points in the low to mid 70s F.

8,1455,18:36,"Iowa (far E), Wisconsin (S), Illinois (N)",Concerning: SVA #426,"""The potential for widespread and destructive damaging wind gusts of 70-100+ mph and perhaps a tornado or two will continue as a line of storms moves quickly eastwards across northern Illinois.

The airmass across southern Lower Michigan and northern/central Indiana continues to destabilize this afternoon, with surface temperatures having warmed into the mid to upper 80s, and surface dewpoints in the low to mid 70s..."" ""Resultant MLCAPE of 2000-3500 J/kg and around 25-30 kt of effective bulk shear will likely support the maintenance of the severe bow echo as it moves eastward across these areas this afternoon and early evening. Severe wind gusts, some 75+ mph, will likely produce numerous to widespread damaging winds, and a tornado or two cannot be ruled out with the circulations embedded within the line. This substantial severe wind risk is expected to increase within the next couple of hours, and a Severe Thunderstorm Watch will be issued to address this threat.""",[166]
10,1457,19:38,"Missouri, Kansas (far E), Illinois (S)",Issuing: SVA #428,"""Given the widespread destabilization that has occurred, and the convective trends noted, convection should become more widespread throughout the afternoon. Despite ample instability, winds aloft are generally weak, with only about 20 kt of effective bulk shear present, with perhaps some enhancement near the MCS in central Illinois. Thus storms should form into a few multi-cell clusters, posing a threat for damaging winds and large hail. Convective trends will be monitored this for a potential watch issuance this afternoon.""",[167]

Even so, the overall bow echo remains well organized, and it is moving through a very strongly unstable airmass (3500-400+ J/kg MLCAPE).""...""A tornado or two embedded within the line also remains possible across this area, but the primary risk is still widespread damaging straight-line winds.""",[168]
12,1459,20:46,"Wisconsin (E), Michigan (N)",Concerning: SVA #427,"""Storms are expected to continue moving from west to east across the watch area in advance of a cold front, with perhaps some increase in coverage. Uncertainty exists in whether or not the convection will persist as it crosses northern parts of Lake Michigan and entering into the L.P. of Michigan. Presently there exists a corridor of enhanced instability (MLCAPE near 2000 J/kg) and nearly homogeneous effective shear (30-35 kt). These conditions are forecast to persist into the evening hours. Thus, should trends in convective coverage/intensity persist, a downstream watch may be considered for parts of the region.""",[169]

Still, given the very well-organized nature of this convective system, an organized/bowing band is likely to continue east and southeast of the existing watches. While a severe risk should begin to diminish/become more isolated this evening, a new WW issuance -- into eastern lower Michigan and western Ohio, may be required. Some risk may also spread southeast of the existing watches across the Ohio River into northern Kentucky as well --- which could also require WW consideration.""

Some weakening has been noted over the past 1 to 2 hours with northern portions of the line -- i.e. lower Michigan, eastern Indiana, and now western Ohio. Here, weaker instability is indicated with eastward extent. Thus, while locally gusty/damaging winds will likely persist with stronger updrafts within the convective band, risk should remain limited and isolated for the next few hours, before further weakening occurs.""",[171]
