0,"Typhoon Phanfone, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Ursula, was a strong and deadly tropical cyclone which traversed the Philippines on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in 2019, the first typhoon to do so since Nock-ten in 2016."
1,"Phanfone, which is a Laotian word for animal,  was the twenty-ninth and final named storm of the 2019 Pacific typhoon season."
2,The origins of Phanfone can be traced to an upper-level low which had formed near the Caroline Islands and gradually organized into a tropical depression on December 19.
3,"Moving generally west-northwestward, the system intensified into a tropical storm on December 22 and moved into the Philippine Area of Responsibility(PAR) on the following day as it continued gaining strength."
4,Phanfone intensified to typhoon status shortly before making its first landfall over the Eastern Visayas region on Christmas Eve.
5,"Further intensification ensued until Christmas Day despite Phanfone making several landfalls over the central Philippine islands, peaking at 150 km/h(93 mph) 10-minute sustained winds with a central pressure dropping to 970 hPa(29 inHg)."
6,Phanfone maintained its typhoon strength for several hours as it exited the Philippines landmass before unfavorable conditions caused it to rapidly deteriorate and dissipate over the South China Sea.
7,"Phanfone crossed the central Philippines after the stronger Kammuri struck nearly the same region merely weeks prior, with a track fairly similar to 2013’s Haiyan."
8,"The system caused destruction in the regions of Eastern Visayas, Western Visayas, and Mimaropa."
9,"The total fatalities of the said typhoon is 50 deaths(with 55 people missing, and over 300 injured) and the damages is at $67.2 million(2019 US dollars) or roughly ₱3.44 billion."
10,"-Meteorological history-
Prior to its formation on December 19, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began monitoring a low pressure system to the southeast of Micronesia."
11,"Showing signs of convection and sufficient banding around a defined center, the JTWC subsequently upgraded its initial warning to a medium chance of development."
12,"Shortly thereafter on December 20, JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, while the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) issued its first advisory on the system."
13,"By December 22, the system gained tropical storm strength and JMA issued the named Phanfone."
14,"Moving generally west-northwestward, Phanfone moved into the Philippine Area of Responsibility(PAR) at 5:00 am PHT December 23 and the Philippine weather bureau PAGASA locally named the system as Ursula."
15,"Owing to favorable conditions, Phanfone intensified further into a severe tropical storm hours later."
16,"By afternoon of December 24, Phanfone gained typhoon strength shortly before making its first three landfalls over Salcedo, Eastern Samar(4:45 pm PHT), Tacloban City(7:30 pm PHT), and Cabucgayan, Biliran(9:15 pm PHT)."
17,"Further intensification ensued until December 25, with Phanfone peaking at 00:00 UTC with 150 km/h(93 mph) 10-minute sustained winds and a central pressure dropping to 970 hPa; the JTWC reported that Phanfone peaked at 175 km(109 mi)nute sustained winds, equivalent to a Category 2 typhoon."
18,"Phanfone continued its west-northwestward track and, by afternoon of the same day, PAGASA had reported four additional landfalls: Gigantes Islands(2:30 am PHT), Ibajay, Aklan(8:40 am PHT), Semirara Island(1:00 pm PHT), and Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro(3:00 pm PHT)."
19,"By December 26, Phanfone had already exited the Philippine landmass, moving northwest over the South China Sea."
20,"After holding strength for several hours, the system began losing strength due to unfavorable sea surface temperatures, medium wind shear and dry air intrusion."
21,"On December 27, Phanfone dropped to tropical storm status while rapidly deteriorating and slowly moving."
22,"On December 28, PAGASA issued its final warning as the system exited the PAR; later, JMA issued their final advisories as Phanfone weakened below warning threshold."
23,"-Preparations and impact-
--Highest Tropical Cyclone Wind Signal--
--Visayas--
The PAGASA issued a signal 3 warning to Northern Samar, Samar, Eastern Samar, Leyte, Biliran and the Camotes Islands, meaning that 65–92 kn(75–106 mph; 120–170 km/h) winds were expected."
24,"The PAGASA also issued a signal 2 warning to the Visayas, meaning that 33–65 kn(38–75 mph; 61–120 km/h) winds were to be expected within 24 hours."
25,"It was issued to the central portion of northern Cebu, northeastern Iloilo, northern Antique, Capiz, Aklan, Southern Leyte, and Negros Occidental, which meant that Phanfone was taking a similar path to the areas hit by the much stronger Typhoon Haiyan."
26,"The Visayas was the worst hit, with Iloilo City having 13 casualties alone that had been either struck by fallen trees, electrocuted or drowned."
