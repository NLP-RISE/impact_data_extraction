20,"Developing into a tropical depression just west of the Cape Verde Islands early on August 31, becoming Tropical Storm Irma shortly afterwards."
21,"Under favorable conditions, Irma underwent rapid intensification, becoming a major hurricane on September 1."
22,"Within a 48-hour period, the hurricane's intensity had increased by 65 mph(105 km/h)."
23,"Fluctuations occurred over the next few days due to internal processes, as The first aircraft reconnaissance mission discovered an eye 29 mi(47 km) in diameter and surface winds of 115 mph(185 km/h) on September 3."
24,"As Irma continued approaching the Leeward Islands, the hurricane underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification, becoming a Category 5 hurricane early on September 5."
25,"The extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify, with maximum sustained winds peaking at 180 mph(290 km/h) shortly afterwards."
26,"Irma acquired annular characteristics around this time, with the storm exhibiting a large, symmetric CDO and an impressive satellite appearance."
27,Irma continued to intensify while approaching the northern Leeward Islands.
28,"At 05:45 UTC on September 6, Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda at peak intensity, with the storm's central minimum pressure having bottomed out at 914 mbar(27.0 inHg) – this was the lowest in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007; the storm also made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 180 mph(290 km/h)."
29,"Irma continued to maintain its peak intensity until 12:00 UTC on September 6 and made additional successive landfalls on that same day, at 11:15 UTC on Sint Maarten, and at 16:30 UTC on Virgin Gorda, in the British Virgin Islands."
30,Irma maintained Category 5 strength for several days as it passed north of the Greater Antilles.
31,"After beginning an eyewall replacement cycle, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8, subsequently ending the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second-longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above 156 mph(251 km/h) – behind only the 1932 Cuba hurricane."
32,The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north.
33,"Once the eyewall replacement cycle was complete, Irma began to re-intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba, before the hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, with winds of 165 mph(266 km/h)."
34,"This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane."

40,"Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall."
41,"Irma finally weakened to a tropical storm on September 11 as it entered southern Georgia, while transitioning into an extratropical cyclone, degenerating into a remnant low early on September 12."

454,"--Florida--
Sporadic reports of looting and burglaries at several Miami Metro area businesses occurred with the theft of non-essential items such as sports apparel and athletic shoes during the height of the storm."
455,"On September 11, Florida Governor Rick Scott conducted an aerial tour to survey the damage to the Keys."
456,The Overseas Highway remained closed while authorities assessed the integrity of the 42 bridges along the route.
457,"Residents returning to the Keys were faced with a police roadblock, to the south of Florida City."
458,"USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln were sent to the Keys area to aid with the recovery."
459,"On September 12, some residents were allowed to return into the Keys as far as Islamorada."
460,"Although road damage blocked entry any farther than Islamorada, bridges had been inspected and found safe to Sugarloaf Key."
461,"By late on September 12, the Overseas Highway had been repaired and the bridges inspected as safe for first responders to travel to Key West."
462,"On September 16, residents were free to return to Marathon."
463,"Residents were allowed to return to Key West the following day, although the Keys remained closed to tourists and a checkpoint remained in place in Florida City."
464,"Due mainly to the widespread loss of power, cell phone service was also reduced after battery backup power for cell phone towers ran out and backup generators ran out of fuel."
465,"In an impact report by the FCC, as of 11 AM EDT on September 12, 89 of 108(82%) cell phone towers were non-functioning in Monroe County(Florida Keys), 154 of 212(73%) were non-functioning in Collier County(Naples), 36 of 46(78%) were non-functioning in Hendry County, and an additional six counties had 41-60% of cell phone towers not functioning, including Lee County(Fort Myers) and Miami-Dade County."
466,NOAA released map-format aerial reconnaissance image data of damage from the storm.
467,"The imagery featured several areas of Florida: including the Florida Keys, the southwest coast of Florida from Marco Island to Punta Gorda, much of the northeast coast of Florida, and portions of the Jacksonville area."
468,Portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts were also photographed.
469,"Additionally, the Sun-Sentinel published before and after photos of several landmarks in the Florida Keys."
470,"In the days after the hurricane, due to the heavy rainfall, numerous rivers had flooded, including residential areas."
471,"Public health risks, such as diarrheal infections and mosquito-borne illnesses, remain from the flooding that resulted in the aftermath of the hurricane."
472,A large concern from flooding is contamination because people become exposed to dirty floodwaters and the potential for contaminated water to enter the local water supply is significant.
473,"One example of an illness that can enter the water supply is leptospirosis, which is rat urine carries into the floodwaters."
474,"Untreated exposure to leptospirosis can cause kidney damage, meningitis, and liver failure."
475,Noroviruses and other infections are also a risk.
476,"Following Irma's passage, a 15 ft(4.6 m) hand-carved wooden canoe was discovered on the banks of the Indian River and could be several hundred years old."
477,The state has removed the canoe for examination and safe keeping.
478,"Due to Irma's and Hurricane Harvey's impact in Florida and Texas, U.S. employment declined in September 2017 for the first time since September 2010."
479,"The leisure and hospitality industries were especially hard hit, losing 111,000 jobs in September."
480,"-Records-
Irma set multiple records for intensity, especially at easterly longitudes, time spent at such an intensity, and its intensity at landfall."
481,"When Irma reached Category 5 intensity with winds of 175 mph(282 km/h) at 11:45 UTC on September 5 at 57.7°W, it became the easternmost Atlantic hurricane of this strength on record, surpassing Hurricane David of 1979, later beaten by Hurricane Lorenzo 2 years later."
482,"By 00:15 UTC on September 6, Irma reached peak intensity with 180 mph(285 km/h) winds and a minimum pressure of 914 mbar(914 hPa; 27.0 inHg)."
483,"This ties it with Hurricane Mitch of 1998, Hurricane Rita of 2005, and Hurricane Milton of 2024 as the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed."
484,"Only five other Atlantic hurricanes have been recorded with wind speeds higher than Irma: Hurricane Allen of 1980, which had maximum sustained winds of 190 mph(310 km/h), and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Hurricane Gilbert of 1988, Hurricane Wilma of 2005, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, all of which had peak winds of 185 mph(298 km/h)."
485,"At the time, Irma was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean outside the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico; later surpassed by Hurricane Dorian, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Wilma in terms of maximum sustained winds, and the most intense in terms of pressure since Dean in 2007."
486,"In addition, Irma achieved one of the longest durations of Category 5 strength winds, and the third-highest accumulated cyclone energy(ACE) index for a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin, with a value of 64.9 units."
487,Only the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane and Hurricane Ivan in 2004 achieved higher values.
488,"On September 6, Irma made landfall on the islands of Barbuda, Saint Martin, and Virgin Gorda at peak strength."
489,"This ties Irma with cyclones Monica of 2006 and Winston of 2016, and typhoons Zeb of 1998 and Megi of 2010 as the seventh-strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall globally – in terms of sustained winds – trailing only Typhoon Goni of 2020 which bore winds of 195 mph(314 km/h) at landfall, Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 and Typhoon Meranti of 2016, which bore winds of 190 mph(310 km/h) at landfall, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Typhoon Joan of 1959, and Hurricane Dorian of 2019, which bore winds of 185 mph(298 km/h) at landfall."
490,"Irma is second to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 as the strongest landfalling cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, and is the first hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the Atlantic at Category 5 status since Felix in 2007."
491,"Irma is the first recorded Category 5 hurricane to affect the northern Leeward Islands, and was one of the worst storms to hit the region on record, along with Hurricane Donna in 1960 and Hurricane Luis in 1995."
492,"In addition, Irma is only the second hurricane on record to make landfall in Cuba at Category 5 intensity, with the other being a hurricane in 1924."
493,"Furthermore, when Irma made landfall on Barbuda, Saint Martin, Virgin Gorda, and Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane, it became one of only two recorded Atlantic storms to make landfall in multiple nations at this strength; the other was Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which struck both Eleuthera and the United States as a Category 5 hurricane."
494,"Irma made landfall in the Florida Keys with winds of 130 mph(210 km/h) and a pressure of 931 mbar(931 hPa; 27.5 inHg), making it the strongest hurricane to strike Florida in terms of wind speed since Charley in 2004, and the most intense to strike the state in terms of barometric pressure since Andrew in 1992."
495,"In the span of two weeks, two Category 4 hurricanes—Harvey and Irma—struck the continental United States, the first time on record two Atlantic tropical cyclones of such strength made landfall on the country in the same hurricane season."
496,This also marked only the third occurrence of two consecutive Atlantic storms making landfall in the United States as major hurricanes.
497,"The other two instances were the Great Charleston and Cheniere Caminada hurricanes in 1893, and hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne in 2004."
498,"-Retirement-
Because of the extensive damage and loss of life the hurricane caused in the northeastern Caribbean and the United States, particularly in Florida, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Irma from its rotating naming lists in April 2018; it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane."
499,It was replaced with Idalia for the 2023 season.
