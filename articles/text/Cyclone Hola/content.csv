10,"-Meteorological history-
In early March 2018, a trough of low pressure extended across Fiji, resulting in inclement weather across a broad area."
11,"A poorly organized low developed within this trough to the northwest of Fiji, later being classified as Tropical Disturbance 03F by the Fiji Meteorological Service(FMS)."
12,The system produced persistent convection as it moved generally west-northwest toward Vanuatu under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the south.
13,"By 5 March, winds up to gale-force winds developed around the circulation and the FMS classified it as a tropical depression."
14,"Around the same time, the United States-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center also classified the system as a tropical depression, assigning it the identifier 12P. The following day, convection became increasingly organized and consolidated around the cyclone's center with banding features forming around its periphery."
15,"Satellite scatterometer data showed an area of gale-force winds along the north-eastern side of the storm and with the aforementioned development, the JTWC classified the system as a tropical cyclone with its center located 210 km(130 mi) north-northeast of Port Vila, Vanuatu."
16,"Similarly, the FMS upgraded the depression to a Category 1 tropical cyclone and assigned it the name Hola."
17,"Overall environmental conditions favored further intensification, marked by ample outflow aloft, high sea surface temperatures of 30 °C(86 °F), and moderate wind shear that was mitigated by the storm's westward trajectory."
18,"Conditions soon became even more favorable as shear decreased, raising the likelihood of rapid intensification."
19,"Indeed Hola strengthened quickly as it approached north-eastern Vanuatu, with SSMIS imagery depicting a formative eye feature and winds reaching storm-force winds late on 6 March."
20,Hola crossed the islands of Ambrym and Pentecost on 6–7 March; interaction with the land masses of Vanuatu disrupted the storm's core temporarily.
21,"The system subsequently passed over the island of Malekula and moved into the Coral Sea during 7 March, where it rapidly consolidated and developed a 10 km(5 mi) pinhole eye."
22,The FMS subsequently reported that Gita had become a Category 4 Severe Tropical Cyclone and predicted that Hola would peak as a Category 5 Severe Tropical Cyclone.
23,"However, during the following day Hola's eye weakened and became cloud filled, as it stalled to the west of Vanuatu."
24,"As a result, the FMS reported that the system had peaked as a Category 4 Severe Tropical Cyclone with 10-minute sustained winds of 165 km/h(105 mph)."
25,"During 8 March, the JTWC also reported that Hola had peaked with 1-minute sustained winds of 185 km/h(115 mph), which made it equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale."
