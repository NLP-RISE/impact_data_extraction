2,"It quickly intensified while moving westward, becoming a strong tropical storm before hitting northeastern Mozambique on December 31."
3,"Delfina weakened while moving inland, and it was no longer classifiable as a tropical cyclone by January 1, 2003."
4,"However, its remnants moved across the country and into Malawi, later looping around and crossing back over Mozambique; the remnants of Delfina were last observed on January 9."

6,"In the former country, over 18,000 houses were severely damaged or destroyed, leaving thousands homeless."

8,"Lingering flooding caused an outbreak of cholera and malaria in Mozambique, and 47 people were killed by Delfina."
9,"In Malawi, flooding was not widespread, although the storm destroyed about 3,600 houses and killed eight people."

13,"At 1200 UTC that day, Météo-France classified the system as the sixth zone of disturbed weather of the season."
14,"It quickly developed, organizing into Tropical Disturbance 6 at 1800 UTC on December 30."
15,"At around the same time, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 08S. The convection became better organized, developing outflow and rainbands."
16,"With a ridge to the south, the storm tracked in a generally westward direction toward Mozambique."
17,"At 0600 UTC on December 31, MFR upgraded the system to Tropical Depression 6, and six hours later the agency upgraded it to Tropical Storm Delfina."

19,"At 1800 UTC on December 31, MFR estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 95 km/h(60 mph)."
20,"At about 2130 UTC, Delfina made landfall near Angoche in eastern Mozambique."
21,"It rapidly weakened while moving inland, and MFR discontinued advisories early on January 1, 2003."

23,"The remnants turned to the northeast, drifting into Mozambique and later turning to the south."
24,"On January 6, it crossed over its track and emerged into the Mozambique Channel."
25,"When the remnants reached the Mozambique Channel, they were reclassified as Tropical Disturbance 07, which moved southward over waters."
26,"It re-intensified into a tropical storm on January 8 before weakening the next day, becoming extratropical."
27,"The remnants persisted for several days, dissipating on January 14."
28,"-Impact and aftermath-
Upon striking Mozambique, Delfina produced strong winds and heavy rains, particularly in the northern portion of the country."
29,A station in Nampula reported 281 mm(11.1 in) in a 48‑hour period.
30,"Delfina washed out roads and bridges in Nampula and Zambezia provinces, which isolated towns and disrupted the transportation network."
31,"A train derailed due to effects from the storm, which cut rail travel between northern Mozambique and neighboring Malawi."
32,"The cyclone destroyed or severely damaged over 18,000 houses, which directly affected about 133,000 people, mostly in Nampula where 22,000 people were displaced."
33,"Floods along the Ligonha River forced 1,800 people to leave their homes."

36,"The cyclone destroyed over 2,000 ha(4,900 acres) of beans and cassava crops and knocked down thousands of cashew trees, in areas already affected by food shortages due to drought conditions."
37,"Overall, Delfina resulted in $3.5 million in damage(2003 USD), and caused 47 deaths in the country, at least 19 due to flooding."
38,"After Delfina moved through Mozambique, the local Red Cross chapter provided shelter, water, and relief items to the affected residents."
39,"Residual flooding in northern Mozambique, compounded with lack of drinking water, caused a cholera outbreak that affected at least 400 people."
