On August 28, a large area of convection persisted about 1,035 km(643 mi) east of Guam."
20,"Located within an area of moderate wind shear, the system quickly organized while moving westward, its track influenced by a ridge to the north."
21,"At 00:00 UTC on August 29, a tropical depression formed from the system, classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) as Tropical Depression 14W. In initial forecasts, the agency anticipated steady strengthening, due to warm sea surface temperatures in the area."
22,"At 12:00 UTC on August 29, the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) upgraded it to a tropical storm."
23,"As such, the JMA named the storm Nabi."
24,"About 12 hours later, the JMA upgraded Nabi further to a severe tropical storm, after the convection organized into spiral rainbands."
25,"At 18:00 UTC, Nabi intensified to typhoon status, reaching ten-minute sustained winds of 120 km/h(75 mph)."
26,"On August 31, Nabi passed about 55 km(34 mi) north-northeast of Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands during its closest approach."
27,The typhoon continued to intensify quickly as it moved to the west-northwest.

31,"For about 36 hours, Nabi maintained its peak winds, during which it crossed into the area of responsibility of PAGASA; the Philippine-based agency gave it the local name ""Jolina"", although the storm remained away from the country."
32,"On September 3, Nabi began weakening as it turned more to the north, the result of an approaching trough weakening the ridge."
33,"Later that day, the winds leveled off at 155 km/h(96 mph), according to the JMA."
34,"On September 5, Nabi passed near Kitadaitōjima and Yakushima, part of the Daitō and Ōsumi island groups offshore southern Japan."
