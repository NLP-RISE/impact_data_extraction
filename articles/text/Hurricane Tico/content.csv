9,The remains were tracked into the Mid-Atlantic States for five more days.
10,Tico was the deadliest and most destructive tropical cyclone of the season.

21,"-Meteorological history-
The origins of Hurricane Tico were from a weak tropical disturbance that crossed Costa Rica into the Pacific Ocean on October 7."
22,"It tracked westward through an area of progressively warmer water temperatures, and by October 11 the system was sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Twenty-One, about 575 mi(930 km) south of the Mexican port of Acapulco."
23,"The depression initially maintained a west-northwest motion, although on October 12 it turned sharply northward, due to the influence of a strong trough moving eastward through Mexico."
24,"Gradually organizing, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Tico on October 13 by the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center(EPHC)."
25,Tropical Storm Tico continued to intensify as it progressed toward the southwest Mexican coastline.
26,"A Hurricane Hunters flight late on October 13 indicated the beginnings of an eyewall, 14 miles(22 km) in diameter, although the eye was open and incomplete."
27,"The next day, Tico strengthened further to attain hurricane status, about 190 mi(310 km) off the Guerrero coast."
28,"Around that time, a building ridge to the north of Tico turned the hurricane northwestward away from land."
29,"The intensity fluctuated by about 20 mph(35 km/h) for two days, during which it curved more to the west."
30,"By October 16, its strengthening rate quickened, and Tico reached major hurricane status(Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale)."
31,"After briefly weakening into a Category 2 hurricane, Hurricane Tico again attained major hurricane strength."
32,"Meanwhile, another trough moved eastward across northwestern Mexico; as a result, the hurricane turned northwestward and began accelerating while maintaining a well-defined eye."
33,"Early on October 19, it reached peak winds of 135 mph(215 km/h), equivalent to a powerful Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale(SSHWS), while located about 200 mi(320 km) south-southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula."
34,"It weakened slightly as it approached the coast, and at about 1500 UTC that day Tico made landfall very near Mazatlán with winds of 125 mph(205 km/h)."
35,"It rapidly weakened over land and merged with a cold front, although significant moisture from the hurricane persisted into the South Central United States."
36,"After dropping heavy rainfall in Oklahoma, the former low associated with Tico continued northeastward to near Lake Michigan."
37,"Precipitation spread across the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic States as the low turned southeastward, and the remnants of Tico were last observed on October 24 over Ohio."
