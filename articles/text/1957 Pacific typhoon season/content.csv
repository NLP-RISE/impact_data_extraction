0,"The 1957 Pacific typhoon season has no official bounds; it ran year-round in 1957, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between June and December."
1,These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean.
2,"The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the International Date Line."
3,Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see 1957 Pacific hurricane season.
4,Tropical storms formed in the entire west Pacific basin were assigned a name by the Fleet Weather Center on Guam.
5,"-Systems-
Twenty-two tropical storms developed in 1957 in the Northwestern Pacific."
6,"Tropical depressions were likely, but no records are known to exist that would mention any."
7,"Eighteen storms reached typhoon intensity, of which 8 reached super typhoon strength."
8,"An additional storm, Della, came across the Dateline from the Central Pacific, therefore it is not taken account in the total number of storms."
9,"--Tropical Storm 01W--
The first tropical cyclone of the 1957 season, classified as Tropical Storm 01W by the JTWC, was initially identified early on January 3 as a tropical depression over open waters east of the Philippines."
10,"Within several hours, the system intensified into a tropical storm as it tracked west-northwestward."
11,"Later that day, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 45 mph(72 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 995 millibars(29.4 inHg)."
12,Tropical Storm 01W maintained this intensity through January 5 before abruptly weakening to a tropical depression near the eastern Philippines.
13,The system made landfall in eastern Leyte early on January 6 with winds of 35 mph(56 km/h) before dissipating the following day over Romblon.
14,"--Typhoon Rose--
About two weeks after Tropical Storm 01W dissipated over the Philippines, a new tropical depression formed to the southeast of Guam on January 21."
15,Gradual intensification took place as the depression tracked westward.
16,"The JTWC began monitoring the system as Tropical Storm Rose the following day, with the first advisory on the storm placing maximum winds at 50 mph(80 km/h)."
17,"Rose maintained this intensity for roughly 24 hours before undergoing a brief period of rapid intensification, attaining winds of 110 mph(180 km/h) early on January 23."
18,"For most of the day, the now Category 2 typhoon, strengthened at a more modest rate before undergoing a second brief period of rapid intensification."
19,"At the end of the second strengthening phase, Rose had attained its peak intensity just below Category 5 status, on the modern-day Saffirâ€“Simpson Hurricane Scale, with winds of 155 mph(249 km/h), and a minimum pressure of 952 millibars(28.1 inHg)."
20,"Upon attaining this intensity, Rose became the most intense January typhoon on record, surpassing that of Super Typhoon Karen in 1948."
21,"After attaining its peak intensity, Rose began to take a more northerly track and weakened."
22,"Late on January 25, Rose rapidly weakened to a low-end typhoon and by January 26, the system had further weakened to a tropical storm."
23,"The JTWC continued to monitor the weakening tropical storm until January 27, by which time Rose had maximum winds of 40 mph(64 km/h)."
24,"However, the JMA continued monitoring the remnants of Rose as it turned sharply eastward over open waters."
25,"During the afternoon of January 28, the depression nearly stalled as it turned northward before accelerating and losing its identity south of Japan on January 30."

37,Virginia then began to move northwest and weakened to a Category 4 typhoon as it passed east of Luzon on June 23 and June 24.
38,"It turned northward on June 24, strengthened to a secondary peak of 160 mph(260 km/h), and weakened before it made landfall in Taiwan on June 25 as a Category 2 typhoon."
39,Virginia then continued to move north and then northeast until its dissipation on June 28.
40,Virginia was an early season typhoon.

42,The storm left $20 million(1957 USD) in damage.
43,"--Typhoon Wendy--
According to the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship, Wendy originated from a tropical depression well east of the Philippines on July 10."
44,"Developing into a tropical storm several hours later, further development would occur as Wendy tracked northwestwards."
45,"As a result, around three days later, the system became a typhoon."
46,"Further intensification occurred, and around 15:00 UTC on July 14, Wendy peaked with sustained winds of 90 knots(100 mph) and a minimum pressure of 985 hPa."
47,"However, around that time, Wendy made its first landfall in Luzon, causing it to weaken into a Category 1-equivalent typhoon the next day."
48,"Although it temporarily reintensified, attaining a secondary peak with sustained winds of 80 knots(90 mph) around that time, it began rapidly weakening, making its final landfall in Guangdong, China as a high-end tropical storm."
49,"Once inland, Wendy rapidly weakened, dissipating on July 16."
50,"Prior to striking the nation, the Hong Kong Observatory hoisted a No."
51,5 storm signal as Wendy was expected to strike the nation.

61,"Elsewhere, in the Philippines, Wendy brought flooding which killed at least seventy-six, most of them children, and made a further three hundred go missing."
62,This flooding also displaced around thirty thousand people and destroyed several towns.
63,Damage there amounted to $2 million(1957 USD).
64,"Elsewhere, in China's Guangdong Province, over three hundred-thousand people were mobilized to gather crops and take safety precautions due to the storm."
65,"Offshore Guangdong Province, eight people died when their fishing boat sank due to Wendy."
