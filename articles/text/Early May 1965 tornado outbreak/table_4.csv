The tornado struck the Island Park–Mound area, where it destroyed 17 homes,[6] some of which were leveled. The tornado then struck and destroyed most of the Navarre community, where 16 homes were destroyed. The tornado also destroyed all barns and outbuildings on 30 farms. Homes were destroyed on 20 farms as well.[6] According to a 1975 map, which contains the most revised data on the May 6 tornadoes, the tornado dissipated north of Crystal Bay.[5]",

As the tornado continued into Deephaven, it destroyed 100 homes, some of which were completely leveled, including ""large and expensive"" homes.[6] According to official sources, the tornado dissipated after hitting Deephaven, and only two tornadoes hit Fridley;[5] however, Grazulis reports that the tornado turned northeast, continuing beyond Deephaven, passing just south of Medicine Lake, striking Golden Valley, and hitting Fridley at 7:10 p.m. (0110 UTC).[6] Six homes were reportedly damaged in Golden Valley, ""clocks stopped"" in Fridley, and 25 airplanes were damaged or destroyed at Anoka County-Blaine Airport in Blaine.[6] However, the official records end this tornado near Deephaven and only indicate that two tornadoes, not three, hit Fridley.[5]",
