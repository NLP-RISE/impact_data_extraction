0,"From June to August 2022, persistent heatwaves affected parts of Europe, causing evacuations and killing tens of thousands."
1,These heat waves were the deadliest meteorological events in 2022.
2,"The highest temperature recorded was 47.0 °C(116.6 °F) in Pinhão, Portugal, on 14 July."
3,"In June 2022, temperatures of 40–43 °C(104–109 °F) were recorded in parts of Europe, with most severe temperature anomalies in France, where several records were broken."
4,"A second more severe heatwave occurred in mid-July, extending north to the United Kingdom where temperatures surpassing 40 °C(104 °F) were recorded for the first time."
5,The heatwaves were part of climate change in Europe.
6,A third heatwave began in August with parts of France and Spain expected to reach temperatures as high as 38 °C(100 °F).
7,A prolonged hot period also hit the United Kingdom.
8,"Although temperatures in most places in Europe subsided in August, a smaller heatwave impacted France on 12 September, with temperatures reaching 40.1 °C(104.2 °F)."
9,"As a result of the heatwaves, widespread droughts occurred across the continent."
10,"Eurostat reported that the European Union saw 53,000 excess deaths in July, some of which may have occurred because of the heat wave."
11,"The excess death rate was several times higher than in July 2020 or July 2021, a statistic notable due to the COVID-19 pandemic having taken place in Europe during those years."
12,The worst increases were seen in Spain and Cyprus.
13,The total damage of the heatwave reached €40 billion(US$40.2 billion).
14,"-Meteorology-
The June heatwave was the result of an interaction among the high pressures that generate atmospheric stability; Tropical Storm Alex; the strong sunshine of the boreal summer; and an air mass emanating from North Africa that had entered the Iberian Peninsula loaded with suspended dust that caused haze in the centre and south of the peninsula."
15,"Climatologists linked the extreme heat to the impact of climate change, and experts predict that changes in the jet stream as a result of climate change will cause heatwaves with increasing frequency in Europe."
16,"Furthermore, due to the jet stream, the increase in heatwaves for European countries is three-to-four times higher than other countries in northern mid-latitudes, such as the United States."
17,"-Estimates of death toll-
Reports of the death toll varied significantly."
18,"In July 2023, researchers from Barcelona Institute for Global Health estimated 61,672 heat-induced problems between 30 May and 4 September in a finding published in Nature Medical."
19,The study gathered data from 35 countries with a combined population of 543 million people.
20,A statistical framework was paired against historical meteorological records to observe the trend of deaths.
21,The researchers said that they used weekly mortality data to develop their model which may not allow for short-term changes and hence may underestimate the actual number of deaths.
22,"Countries around the Mediterranean Sea, especially Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece, experienced higher death rates."
23,"In November 2022, Reuters stated that there were 20,000 ""excess"" deaths recorded; deaths which officials did not directly attribute to heat but may be heat-induced."
24,"In November 2023, the Barcelona Institute for Global Health revised their number to over 70,000 ""excess"" deaths after developing a new method to calculate the mortality rate."
25,The new research utilised daily temperature and mortality data as opposed to the previous research method using weekly data.
26,The researchers claimed the previous figure underestimated the true number by 10.28 percent.
