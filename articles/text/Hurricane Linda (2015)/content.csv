0,Hurricane Linda was a strong tropical cyclone in September 2015 that resulted in heavy rains across portions of Mexico and the Southwestern United States.
1,"The seventeenth named storm, eleventh hurricane, and eighth major hurricane of the season, Linda developed southwest of Mexico from a low-pressure area on September 5."
2,"Under warm sea surface temperatures and low to moderate wind shear, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Linda by September 6 and a hurricane by the next day."
3,A well-defined eye soon formed within the storm's central dense overcast and Linda reached its peak intensity as a 125 mph(205 km/h) Category 3 major hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale on September 8.
4,"Thereafter, the storm moved into a stable environment and an area of lower sea surface temperatures, causing rapid weakening."
5,Convective activity dissipated and Linda degenerated into a remnant low on September 10.
6,"The lingering system persisted southwest of Baja California, ultimately opening up into a trough on September 14."
7,"In Mexico, the storm brought rainfall to nine states, causing flooding, especially in Oaxaca, Sinaloa, and Zacatecas."
8,"In Oaxaca, mudslides resulted in the closure of multiple highways and damage to over a dozen homes."
9,"Flooding in Sinola affected approximately 1,000 homes with hundreds damaged, prompting dozens of families to evacuate."
10,Several small communities were temporarily isolated after flood waters covered bridges.
11,"Localized flooding in Zacatecas damaged crops and 25 dwellings; damage reached approximately 500,000 pesos(US$30,000)."
12,"Although Linda did not directly impact land, moisture from the storm was pulled northeast into the Southwestern United States and enhanced the local monsoon."
13,"Los Angeles received 2.39 in(61 mm) of rain, contributing to the city's second wettest September on record."
14,One fatality in the state occurred from a drowning at San Bernardino National Forest.
15,Utah was impacted by major flash flooding incidents—with rainfall amounting to 1-in-100 year levels—which left 21 deaths in the state: 14 near Hildale and 7 in Zion National Park.
16,This flash flooding ultimately made this the deadliest storm in the history of Utah since at least 1950.
17,Damage across the Southwest amounted to US$3.6 million.
18,"-Meteorological history-
A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on August 21."
19,"By four days later, the system spawned Tropical Storm Erika over the eastern Atlantic."
20,The southern portion of the wave persisted westward and moved over Central America on August 30.
21,Shower and thunderstorm activity associated with the wave began to increase over the next few days as it crossed the Gulf of Tehuantepec.
22,"Convection was enhanced further on September 2 as a Kelvin wave interacted with the tropical wave, eventually resulting in the development of a broad low-pressure area."
23,"Early the following day, the National Hurricane Center(NHC) issued a Tropical Weather Outlook(TWO) for a cluster of convection that showed signs of organizing into a tropical system."
24,Wind shear was forecast to become more conducive for tropical cyclogenesis over the next few days.
25,"Although the shear remained moderately strong, the low acquired a well-defined center of circulation by September 4."
26,"Following further organization of deep convection, Tropical Depression Fifteen-E developed at 18:00 UTC on September 5 while located about 490 mi(790 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Colima."
27,"Under the influence of a strong mid-level ridge over northern Mexico, the depression moved northwestward into an area of moderate northeasterly vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures."
28,"By 06:00 UTC on September 6, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Linda."
29,"Due to a decrease in wind shear, Linda began to undergo rapid deepening shortly thereafter."
30,"Between that day and early on September 7, the storm increased in convective banding and developed central dense overcast; satellite imagery also indicated that an eye was forming around that time."
31,"At 06:00 UTC on September 7, Linda intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale."
32,"Just six hours later, the cyclone reached Category 2 status."
33,"Due to a slight increase in wind shear and possibly an intrusion from dry air, Linda temporarily remained steady in intensity while passing between Socorro Island and Clarion Island."
34,"Operationally, the NHC briefly downgraded Linda to a Category 1 hurricane at 0:300 UTC on September 8, though post-analysis concluded that the storm remained a Category 2 hurricane."
35,"Strengthening resumed by early on September 8, when the system became a Category 3 hurricane, which coincided with satellite imagery indicating a banded eye feature."
36,"Around 12:00 UTC, Linda attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph(205 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 950 mbar(28 inHg)."
37,"Early on September 9, the hurricane rapidly weakened after entering a region of slightly colder sea surface temperatures, falling to Category 2 by 06:00 UTC and to Category 1 intensity only six hours later."
38,"Around that time, Linda began encountering a dry, stable air mass and ocean temperature under 26.0 °C(78.8 °F)."
39,"At 18:00 UTC on September 9, the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm while also losing convective coverage."
40,"After the remaining showers and thunderstorms detached from the low-level circulation, Linda transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone around 12:00 UTC the following day while situated about 260 mi(415 km) west-southwest of Punta Eugenia, Baja California Sur."
41,"The remnants weakened over the next few days, until degenerating into a trough while still well west of Baja California on September 14."
42,"-Impact and aftermath-
--Mexico--
The outer bands of Linda brought rainfall to nine states across Mexico: Baja California, Baja California Sur, Colima, Jalisco, Nayarit, Sinaloa, Sonora and Zacatecas."
43,"Within Sinaloa, flooding affected the municipalities of Angostura, Culiacán, Mazatlán, Rosario, and Salvador Alvarado."
44,Rainfall accumulations peaked at 7.4 in(187 mm) in Rosario.
45,"Flooding affected approximately 1,000 homes in the state with hundreds damaged, prompting dozens of families to evacuate."
46,Several small communities were temporarily isolated as flood waters covered bridges.
47,Civil officials declared an emergency for the municipalities of Rosario and Salvador Alvarado in the wake of Linda.
48,Scattered power outages occurred in Mazatlán city.
49,"Scattered thunderstorms in Oaxaca resulted in multiple landslides and flooding, prompting closure of several highways and damaging more than a dozen homes."
50,"Localized flooding attributed to Linda in Zacatecas damaged crops and 25 homes; losses reached MXN$500,000(US$27,000)."
51,"Waves of 6.6 to 9.8 ft(2 to 3 m) likely impacted coastal areas of Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, and Sonora."
52,"Additionally, Linda passed roughly 100 mi(155 km) west of Socorro Island on September 7; sustained winds reached 28 mph(45 km/h) with gusts to 41 mph(66 km/h)."
