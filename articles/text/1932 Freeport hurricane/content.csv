The Freeport hurricane was first noted by ships on August 12 as a tropical disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico."

11,"Steadily moving to the northwest, the storm began to intensify, reaching hurricane strength on August 13, and soon after reaching major hurricane strength later that day."

15,"A ship just offshore of the coast reported a minimum pressure of 942 mbar(27.8 inHg), but the official estimate for the hurricane's landfall intensity was set to 935 mbar(27.6 inHg) given the fact that the system was still rapidly intensifying at the time."
16,"Due to the storm's small size, it quickly weakened to tropical storm strength later that day."
17,The storm finally weakened into a tropical depression before dissipating the next day over the Texas Panhandle.
