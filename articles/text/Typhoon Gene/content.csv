22,"-Meteorological history-
The origins of Typhoon Gene, the fifth tropical cyclone of September 1990, can be traced back to an area of disturbed weather with a surface pressure of 1008 mbar(29.8 inHg) first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) at 06:00 UTC early on September 18."
23,"Little development occurred over the next five days, although the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) classified the disturbance as a tropical depression on the morning of September 22."
24,"A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert(TCFA) was issued at 06:00 UTC on September 23, followed by an increase in the disturbance's organization."
25,"Around that time, the system was located roughly 1,170 km(725 mi) south-southeast of Okinawa."
26,Further development was aided by a tropical upper tropospheric trough to its west and the warm ocean waters of the Kuroshio Current.
27,"Initially, the disturbance tracked generally westward, south of a subtropical ridge."
28,Shower activity steadily increased and a Dvorak estimate of T2.0/55 km/h(35 mph) prompted the JTWC to designate it a tropical depression midday on September 23.
29,"Twelve hours later, the JMA reported that the depression had strengthened into a tropical storm, and after the system improved in organization and its outflow expanded, the JTWC followed suit."
30,"At this time, Tropical Storm Gene was situated 980 km(610 mi) south-southeast of Okinawa."
31,Tropical Storm Gene intensified at the climatological rate of one T number per day as it tracked westward on a course initially resembling a straight runner.
32,"At 00:00 UTC on September 25, the JMA classified Gene as a severe tropical storm."
33,The storm then turned northwest as it approached a break in the subtropical ridge.
34,"Although restricted upper-level outflow prevented rapid intensification, a Dvorak intensity estimate of T4.0/120 km/h(75 mph) lead to both agencies to declare Gene a typhoon on the evening of September 25."
35,"Around the time of the upgrade, Gene was located 380 km(235 mi) south-southwest of Okinawa."
36,"At 00:00 UTC on September 26, the JMA raised its intensity to 130 km/h(80 mph) for its maximum sustained winds, while the agency also estimated a minimum pressure of 965 mbar(28.5 inHg)."
37,"However, the JTWC suggested that Gene was still slowly strengthening, and did not attain its maximum intensity of 90 mph(145 km/h) until 18:00 UTC that day."
38,Gene recurved to the northeast on September 27 in response to a shortwave trough while passing through the Ryukyu Islands.
39,"According to the JTWC, Gene maintained its peak intensity until 06:00 UTC on September 29, although the JMA estimated that a weakening trend had begun six hours earlier."
40,The typhoon continued to recurve and skirted Kyushu and Shikoku on September 29 before tracking just south of Honshu the following day.
41,"Based on surface observations, the JTWC downgraded Gene into a tropical storm at 06:00 UTC that day, with the JMA doing the same at around the same time."
42,"The JMA classified Gene as an extratropical cyclone at noon, even though the JTWC did not follow suit until six hours later."
43,"Finally, the JMA stopped tracking the extratropical remnants of Gene on October 1."
