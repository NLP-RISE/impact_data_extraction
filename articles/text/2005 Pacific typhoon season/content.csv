0,"The 2005 Pacific typhoon season was the least active typhoon season since 2000, producing 23 named storms, of which 13 became typhoons(including 3 super typhoons)."
1,"It was an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation, in which tropical cyclones form in the western Pacific Ocean."
2,"The season ran throughout 2005, though most tropical cyclones typically develop between May and October."
3,"The season's first named storm, Kulap, developed on January 13, while the season's last named storm, Bolaven, dissipated on November 20."
4,"The season's first typhoon, Haitang, reached typhoon status on July 13, and became the first super typhoon of the year three days later."
5,"The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, to the north of the equator between 100°E and the 180th meridian."
6,"Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones, which can often result in a cyclone having two names, one from the JMA and one from PAGASA."
7,"The Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km/h(40 mph) anywhere in the basin, while the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration(PAGASA) assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N–25°N regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA."
8,"Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) are given a number with a ""W"" suffix."
9,"-Seasonal forecasts-
During the year several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many tropical cyclones, tropical storms, and typhoons will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country."
10,"These agencies included the Tropical Storm Risk(TSR) Consortium of University College London, PAGASA and Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau."
11,Some of the forecasts took into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the La Niña conditions that were observed during the previous year.
12,"On March 14, TSR published their extended range forecast for the 2005 season, in which the anticipated that they would see tropical activity slightly below the average."
13,They predicted that there would be a total of 25-26 tropical storms and 16 typhoons.
14,"The TSR, however, forecast that their number of intense typhoons would go slightly above the average, bringing their prediction of 10 intense typhoons."
15,"Their main reasons behind this is due to weaker trade force winds occurring in many parts of the basin, and there would be an enhanced cyclonic vorticity over the northwestern part of the Pacific."
16,"On April 27, the GCACIC made their first forecast for the season, expecting about 24 tropical storms developing, in which 15 of them would strengthen into typhoons."
17,"By May 5, TSR published their first forecast, still predicting a near average typhoon season."
18,"Around this time, 27-28 tropical storms, 17-18 typhoons and 9 intense typhoons were predicted, with the slight increase of the number of tropical storms were due to a slight increase in temperatures within the Niño 3.75 region."
19,"TSR's second forecast was released on June 7, now predicting a slightly above average season, with the only change for their predicted cyclone numbers was a slight increase of intense typhoons to 9.4."
20,"The GCACIC made their second and final forecast for the season on June 24, slightly increasing their numbers to 25 tropical storms and 16 typhoons."
21,The TSR maintained their predictions after their third forecast update on July 5.
22,Sea-surface temperatures within the Pacific were predicted to be more warmer than that predicted back in the May forecast.
23,"On August 5, TSR released their fourth and final forecast for the season, still remaining the same numbers along with the same reasonings."
24,"-Seasonal summary-
The Accumulated Cyclone Energy(ACE) index for the 2005 Pacific typhoon season as calculated by Colorado State University using data from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center was 309.9 units."
25,"The 2005 season was a near-average season, the number of typhoons in the year was twenty-three, much less than the average of twenty-seven."
26,"The number of typhoons that made landfall in Japan was three, which is almost the average(2.6)."
27,"In general, this is not a year in which the impact of typhoons has been especially notable."
28,"The number of typhoons that passed near Okinawa was eight, which is slightly larger than the average of seven, and this is because this year there are some typhoons moving through the Sakishima Islands towards the Taiwan or China."
29,This year's major typhoons are reviewed below.
30,"Although the season was quiet, some typhoons caused extensive damages in many places, especially in China where eight typhoons struck the country."
31,"First, Typhoon Haitang became the strongest storm in the basin this year and caused about $1.1 billion in damages in Taiwan and China in mid July."
32,"In August, Typhoon Matsa made landfall in Eastern China and caused about $2.23 billion in damages."
33,"Later that same month, two powerful typhoons made landfall, causing extreme damage and some casualties."
34,"Similar to Haitang, Typhoon Longwang made landfall in Taiwan and China at a strong intensity causing damages."
35,"-Systems-
--Severe Tropical Storm Kulap--
On January 12, a tropical disturbance developed within an area of light vertical wind shear."
36,This allowed deep convection to develop over a broad low-level circulation.
37,"The next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert(TCFA) as the system continued to develop."
38,"Later that day, they issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 01W while the storm was located about 215 km(134 mi) southwest of Chuuk."
39,"Several hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) also designated the system as a tropical depression."
40,"Early on January 15, the JTWC upgraded 01W to a tropical storm as the system turned towards the north."
41,The northward movement was the result of the system traveling along the edge of a low to mid-level ridge located to the east.
42,"About 12 hours later, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Kulap; which was contributed by Thailand and is the Thai word for rose."
43,"Kulap gradually intensified over the next two days, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 95 km/h(59 mph) 10-minute winds) around 1800 UTC on January 17, making it a severe tropical storm according to the JMA."
44,"However, at the same time the JMA assessed Kulap to have reached its peak intensity, the JTWC classified it as a minimal typhoon with winds of 120 km/h(75 mph) 1-minute winds)."
45,"Shortly after reaching its peak intensity, the storm began to undergo an extratropical transition and weaken."
46,"Late on January 18, the JTWC issued their final advisory on Kulap despite the storm remaining tropical."
47,The JMA considered Kulap to have been a tropical storm until early the next day.
48,The storm dissipated as a weak extratropical system around 1200 UTC on January 19.
49,"Between January 13 and 14, the storm produced heavy rains over the island of Chuuk."

270,"The next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency initiated marine warnings for a Tropical Depression."
271,"Fifteen hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued the number 22W to the system."
272,The next day it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Kai-tak.
273,Kai-tak was a name submitted by Hong Kong in honor of their former airport.
274,On October 30 it was upgraded to a Typhoon.
275,"Kai-tak made landfall north of Huế, Vietnam, early on the morning of November 2."
276,At least 19 people were killed and 10 others were left missing in Vietnam.
277,Damages from the storm were estimated to be at least $11 million(2005 USD).
278,"--Tropical Storm Tembin(Ondoy)--
The Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated warning for Tropical Depression 23W at 0900 UTC November 7, north-northwest of the Micronesian island of Yap."
279,The storm gained enough power to warrant upgrading to a Tropical Storm 12 hours later.
280,The system entered the Philippine area of responsibility on the morning of November 8 and was named Ondoy by PAGASA.
281,"The storm encountered shear as it moved west, and lost organisation on November 8, being downgraded to a tropical depression."
282,On November 9 it regained tropical storm strength and had a better LLCC(low-level circulation centre).
283,On November 10 it was named Tembin by the JMA.
284,Tembin is a Japanese constellation for the group of stars known in the west as Libra.
285,Tembin then made landfall near midnight November 11 local time in the northern Philippines and lost much of its circulation and convection.
286,Tembin dissipated rapidly the next day.
287,"--Severe Tropical Storm Bolaven(Pepeng)--
A low-pressure area formed along from the outflow of Tropical Storm Tembin on November 10."
288,The Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated a TCFA warning for a low-pressure system about 150 nautical miles(280 kilometres) west-southwest of Palau late on November 12.
289,"This was upgraded to a tropical depression the next afternoon, 290 nautical miles(540 kilometres) west of Palau."
290,Forming inside the Philippine area of responsibility it has been named Pepeng by PAGASA.
291,It was named Bolaven on November 16 by the JMA.

300,"-Storm names-
Within the North-western Pacific Ocean, both the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assign names to tropical cyclones that develop in the Western Pacific, which can result in a tropical cyclone having two names."
301,"The Japan Meteorological Agency's RSMC Tokyo — Typhoon Center assigns international names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the World Meteorological Organization's Typhoon Committee, should they be judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65 km/h(40 mph)."
302,"While the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N-25°N even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it."
303,"The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired, by both PAGASA and the Typhoon Committee."
304,Should the list of names for the Philippine region be exhausted then names will be taken from an auxiliary list of which the first ten are published each season.
305,Unused names are marked in gray.
306,"--International names--
During the season 23 named tropical cyclones developed in the Western Pacific and were named by the Japan Meteorological Agency, when it was determined that they had become tropical storms."
307,These names were contributed to a list of a 140 names submitted by the fourteen members nations and territories of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee.
308,"Each of the names in this list, except for Damrey, Longwang, Kirogi, Kai-tak, Tembin, and Bolaven, were assigned to storms for the first time(and only, in the cases of Matsa and Nabi)."
309,"--Philippines--
During this season, PAGASA used its own naming scheme for the 22 tropical cyclones, that either developed within or moved into their self-defined area of responsibility."
310,Names not retired would be used again during the 2009 season.
311,"This was the same list used during 2001, except Bising, Dante, Nando, Pepeng, Ramil, Santi, Tino, Undang, Yolanda, Zoraida, Ernie, Florante, Gerardo, Hernan and Jerome, which replaced Barok, Darna, Nanang, Pabling, Roleta, Sibak, Talahib, Ubbeng, Yaning, Zuma, Ekis, Fuerza, Gimbal, Hampas, and Juego."
312,"The names Dante, Nando and Pepeng were used for the first time this year; Bising was previously included in the old lists."
313,"--Retirement--
Following the season, the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee would retire Matsa, Nabi, and Longwang from the naming lists."
314,"They would be replaced by Pakhar, Doksuri, and Haikui for future seasons."
315,"No PAGASA names were retired this year, although the unused name Undang was later changed to Urduja, as it was already retired in 1984."
316,"-Season effects-
This table summarizes all the systems that developed within or moved into the North Pacific Ocean, to the west of the International Date Line during 2005."
317,"The tables also provide an overview of a system's intensity, duration, land areas affected and any deaths or damages associated with the system."
