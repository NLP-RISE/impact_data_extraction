0,Tropical Storm Josephine was an unusual tropical cyclone that moved from west to east across the Gulf of Mexico in October 1996.
1,It formed on October 4 as a tropical depression from the remnants of a cold front.
2,"Early in its duration, the system interacted with a ridge over the central United States, which produced strong winds and high tides along the Texas coast."
3,"The outer rainbands caused flooding rainfall in southern Texas, and in Louisiana, high tides flooded roads and stranded residents on Grand Isle."

17,"-Meteorological history-
In late September 1996, a cold front stalled over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, producing an area of convection."
18,The thunderstorms were possibly related to the same tropical wave that spawned Hurricane Hernan in the eastern Pacific Ocean.
