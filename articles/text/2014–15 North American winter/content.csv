0,"The 2014–15 North American winter was frigid and prolifically wintry, especially across the eastern half of North America in the months of January–March."
1,"The season began early, with many places in North America experiencing their first wintry weather during mid-November."
2,"A period of below-average temperatures affected much of the contiguous United States, and several records were broken."
3,A quasi-permanent phenomenon referred to as the polar vortex may have been partly responsible for the cold weather.
4,"Temperatures in much of the United States dropped 15 to 35 °F(8.3 to 19 °C) below average by November 19, following a southward ""dip"" of the polar vortex into the eastern two-thirds of the country."
5,"The effects of this dip were widespread, bringing about temperatures as low as 28 °F(−2 °C) in Pensacola, Florida."
6,"Following a significant snowstorm there, Buffalo, New York received several feet of snow from November 17–21."
7,"In addition, significant winter weather occurred throughout the season, including a major blizzard that struck the Northeastern United States at the end of January, another blizzard that affected much of the Northern United States days later in early February, and several significant snow events paired with very frigid temperatures for much of February."
8,"While there is no well-agreed-upon date used to indicate the start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, there are two definitions of winter which may be used."
9,"Based on the astronomical definition, winter begins at the winter solstice, which in 2014 occurred on December 21, and ends at the March equinox, which in 2015 occurred on March 20."
10,"Based on the meteorological definition, the first day of winter is December 1 and the last day February 28."
11,"Both definitions involve a period of approximately three months, with some variability."
12,"Many records for snowfall and temperature were broken, many for the month of February, with every state east of the Mississippi River being colder than average, some for the entire winter."
13,"However, this meteorological winter was the 19th-warmest of the past 120 winters over the Contiguous United States, largely due to persistent warm weather in the Western United States."
14,"During the 2014–15 winter season, Boston broke its all-time official seasonal 107.6-inch(2.73-meter) snowfall record from the winter of 1995–96, with a total snowfall record of 108.6 inches(2.76 m) as of March 15, 2015."
15,An early trace of snowfall was recorded in Arkansas.
16,There were greater accumulations of snow across parts of Oklahoma as well.
17,"-Seasonal forecasts-
On October 16, 2014, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center issued its U.S. Winter Outlook."
18,"This outlook indicated that below-average temperatures in parts of the south-central and southeastern United States would be favored, with above-average temperatures favored in the western U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, and New England."
19,"Drought conditions were expected to improve in California's southern and northwestern regions, but no improvements were expected earlier than December or January."
20,"Above-average conditions were also expected to pervade the winter months in the western U.S., the Intermountain West extending across the U.S.–Canada border through New York and New England, and Alaska and Hawaii."
21,"The Precipitation Outlook favored above-average precipitation across the southern tier and Atlantic coast of the United States, with above-average precipitation also favored in southern Alaska and the Alaska panhandle."
22,"Below-average precipitation was favored in Hawaii, the northwestern United States, and near the Great Lakes region."
23,"The rest of the country was given an ""equal chance"" for either above- or below-average temperatures and/or precipitation."
24,"On November 30, 2014, Environment Canada's monthly prediction system produced a forecast for the months of December, January, and February across Canada."
25,Areas in and just off the western coast of British Columbia were considered the most likely areas for above-average temperatures.
26,"Other areas where above-average temperatures were favored by the forecast included Yukon, the Northwest Territories, northern parts of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and northwestern parts of Manitoba."
27,"Below-average temperatures were favored in and near Lake Superior in Ontario, across much of Hudson Bay, in far-eastern parts of Nunavut, and in northern parts of Quebec."

29,"The most favorable areas for below-average precipitation were southeastern British Columbia, southern Alberta, southern Saskatchewan, some northern parts of Quebec, and an isolated spot in the northern half of Nunavut."
30,"-Seasonal summary-
The North American winter season of 2014–15 expressed a significant level of variance."
31,"First, a cyclone in the Bering Sea enabled a change in the atmospheric pattern to occur; according to Jeff Masters from Weather Underground, this cyclone brought about a ""ripple"" in the jet stream, and the presence of a high-pressure ridge over the western United States and a low-pressure trough over the southern and central United States enabled a great intrusion of very cold air to pervade southward out of Canada."
32,"Following the onset of the cold wave, multiple snow events occurred; one significant storm dropped as much as 88 inches(220 cm) of snow in a single area, and impacts covered a broad area."
33,"In late November, around Thanksgiving, a nor'easter traveled up the East Coast, dropping up to a foot of snow in some areas, and causing major travel headaches for much of the country."
34,"Due to the storm, over 4,500 flights were canceled and over 400,000 people were without power on November 27; southern New Hampshire was the worst hit, experiencing up to 200,000 outages."
35,"December was, at the time, the second warmest across the US."
36,"However, 2015, 2021 and 2023 have since had warmer Decembers, leaving 2014 in fifth."
37,"In December, yet another storm impacted parts of North America; the storm brought relief to drought-stricken parts of California, but it also brought dangerous mudflows to fire-ravaged areas where the soil could not handle the excess precipitation."
38,"Less than two weeks after this event, another storm impacted the Pacific coast of the United States; this storm, fueled by the ""Pineapple Express"", knocked out power to over one hundred thousand customers in the San Francisco Bay Area after producing strong winds."
39,Hurricane-force winds were reported in parts of the northwestern United States.
40,"Regions reported as much as 9 inches(23 cm) of rainfall, and parts of the Sierra Nevada reported 19 inches(48 cm) of snowfall."
41,"Due to a persistent stationary high-pressure pattern over the west coast that redirects the jet stream, it remained(and remains) in a wavy ideal configuration to bring warm air north over the western U.S. and cold air towards the south over the continental states, and to favor winter storms over the East Coast."
42,"Severe winter blizzards over New England are often associated with this configuration, and nearly all of the snow storms this season followed very similar tracks and had marked similarities in their synoptic evolution."
43,"Boston in particular saw the effects of this, experiencing six major snow storms in the first two months of the year, leaving it with over 105 inches(270 cm) of snow."
44,"January 27 saw first major snowfall of 2015, with observations showing a blocked flow with warm air over the west coast, accompanied by a pronounced cold trough downstream, which pattern looks very similar to the blizzard that Boston saw on January 23, 2005."
45,"As a result, February was record-breaking for many cities in the United States, yet in opposite extremes."
46,"Much of February saw below-average cold in the eastern part of the country, it was markedly warm in the West."
47,"A multitude of cities east of the Mississippi experienced their coldest February in decades, including Chicago, Ill.; Cleveland, Oh.;"
48,"Grand Rapids, Mich.; Harrisburg, Pa.; Hartford, Conn.; and Portland, Maine."
49,"Marquette, Mich. Syracuse, Buffalo and Rochester, N.Y. also set records for coldest month overall, as did Bangor, Maine where the average temperature was 6.1 °F(−14.4 °C)."
50,"And with an average temperature of 2.5 °F(−16.4 °C), the state of Maine itself also set a record low."
51,"For Worcester, Mass, February was the coldest month out of any month on record with an average temperature of just 14.2 °F(−9.9 °C), while also accumulating more than 110 inches(280 cm) of snow this winter."
52,"In contrast, in the West a persistently strong ridge of high pressure over the warm eastern Pacific Ocean and western North America elevated temperatures to record levels from Arizona to Washington."
53,"It was the warmest winter month(December, January, February) on record in San Francisco; Seattle; Portland, Ore.; Reno, Nev.; Las Vegas; and Salt Lake City, with the latter realizing an average temperature for February of 43.9 °F(6.6 °C), breaking the old record set in 1907."
54,"Meanwhile, just 1.1 inches(2.8 cm) of snow fell in the entire month in Anchorage, Alaska, making it the fifth-least-snowy February on record."
55,"Portland and Salem had their warmest February on record, with the latter tying the record set in 1934 for their warmest at 45.9 °F(7.7 °C) degrees with the year."
56,"For the first time in record keeping, every day in February was at least 50 °F(10 °C) in Salem."
57,"California averaged 1.5 °F(0.83 °C) warmer than the previous warmest winter(2013–14), which had broken the previous record(1980–81) by 0.8 °F(−17.3 °C)."
58,"February was the warmest on record in Washington, California, Utah and Arizona, while February was among the top 10 warmest in four other states."
59,"Overall, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that about 30.6 percent of the country was ""very warm"" – meaning February was in the warmest 10 percent of the historical record – while 31.5 percent of the country was ""very cold,"" or in the coldest 10 percent historically."
60,"-Events-
There were several winter weather events during the 2014–15 North American winter."
61,"Significant events include cold waves, snowstorms, and other notable events outside the conventional limits of winter."
62,"--November Bering Sea cyclone--

111,"--Early January winter storm & cold wave--
On December 27, an arctic cold front swung into the Northwestern United States, bringing very cold temperatures behind it."
112,"An area of low pressure formed along this front, and was originally weak at first and produced moderate to heavy snowfall in the Northwest through December 28."
113,"As it approached the Southwest early on December 29, the low intensified somewhat as it neared the subtropical branch of the jet steam, and slowly began to draw moisture from the Pacific Ocean and the western half of the Gulf of Mexico."
114,"This resulted in snowfall totals of up to 2 feet(24 in) in the higher elevations, but also moderate to heavy snow in the lower elevations as well."
115,"As cold air continued to filter in over warm air into the morning of December 30–31, freezing rain began to develop across the southwestern parts of Texas, with accumulations up to 15 millimetres(0.59 in)."

169,"During this time period, a weak area of low pressure formed in the central parts of the U.S, and began to track eastward."
170,"Precipitation was at first relatively scattered, but as the day went on it began to blossom, reaching the Mid-Atlantic by the evening of February 21."
171,"There was more ice then snow in this system, and as a result, periods of freezing rain and sleet were expected in a swath extending from North Carolina to Long Island, with ice accumulations ranging from 0.1–0.5 inches(2.5–12.7 mm), and snow accumulations of 5–8 inches(13–20 cm)."
