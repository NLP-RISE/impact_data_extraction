2,"Forming as the 32nd tropical depression of the season, the system formed on September 26 over the Philippine Sea."
3,"On September 27, it was named Nalgae as it explosively intensified into a typhoon on the next day."
4,Nalgae reached its peak intensity as a Category 4 typhoon on September 30 while it made landfall over Luzon.
5,Nalgae weakened into a tropical storm as it entered the South China Sea on October 1.
6,Nalgae made landfall over the Hainan Island in China on October 4 as it weakened to a tropical depression.
7,Nalgae dissipated on October 5 east of Vietnam.
8,"-Meteorological history-
On September 26, the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) started to monitor a weak tropical depression that had developed about 1,260 km(785 mi) to the northwest of Manila in the Philippines."
9,"During that day, while the depression moved towards the northwest its low level circulation centre rapidly consolidated in an area of favourable conditions for further development of the system."
10,This prompted the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert on the system early the next day.
11,"However less than 3 hours later, the JTWC decided to issue advisories on the system designating it as Tropical Depression 22W, before the JMA reported that the depression had become a tropical storm and named it Nalgae."
12,The storm slowly drifted to the west and kept on intensifying gradually.
13,"On September 29, microwave imagery showed Nalgae developed an eyelike feature and well defined convective banding in all the quadrants."
14,"The system had a tiny radius of winds, though it was still strengthening significantly and was very well defined."
15,"On the evening of September 28, the JMA reported that Nalgae continued to intensify, as they upgraded it to a severe tropical storm with winds of over 55 knots(102 km/h; 63 mph)."
16,"On that night, the PAGASA initiated advisories on Nalgae, giving it the local name Quiel, as it entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility(PAR)."
17,"On the morning of September 29, the JTWC reported that Nalgae developed a small microwave eye like feature and multiple convective bands wrapped tightly into the center."
18,"Using the Dvorak technique, the JTWC estimated the average 1-minute sustained wind speed of Nalgae to be at 65 knots(120 km/h; 75 mph)."
19,"On that evening, the JMA further upgraded Nalgae to a typhoon."
20,Nalgae continued to drift westwards at approximately 13 knots(24 km/h; 15 mph) and continued to intensify.
21,"On the night of September 29, Nalgae's outflow to the east got more enhanced and the outflow in all other directions remained radial."
22,Nalgae was running west quite quickly because of a strong and a deep subtropical ridge located to the east of the system.
23,"The JTWC anticipated Nalgae to continually strengthen before it made landfall over Luzon, Philippines."
24,"Continuing on its quick westward run, Nalgae developed a tiny 5 nautical miles(9.3 km; 5.8 mi) eye with a small break in the eyewall around the eastern periphery, because of a slight vertical wind shear as estimated by the JTWC."
25,There was deep convective banding extending approximately 120 nautical miles(220 km; 140 mi) from the center and the overall outflow remained good.
26,"based on Dvorak intensity estimates, the winds of Nalgae were then raised to 95 knots(176 km/h; 109 mph)."
27,"-Preparations-
--Philippines--
On September 30, the Americans living in Philippines were reminded by the United States government ""to carry their travel documents at all times and secure them in a safe and waterproof location."""

33,Fears worsened as the typhoon came 4 days after Typhoon Nesat devastated the same place and also lead to a state of calamity being declared.
34,"Five towns in Cagayan were still flooded and the same place was to be hit by Nalgae, which is much stronger than Nesat."
35,"--Highest Public Storm Warning Signal--
--China--
On October 3, the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center of China upgraded the rainstorm alert for Typhoon Nalgae to the orange level, the second-highest alert level in the country's four-level rainstorm alert system, reporting that a number of tidal stations off the provinces of Hainan, Guangdong and Fujian would experience tides beyond the ordinary safety levels."
36,The agency asked all the tourists heading to typhoon-hit provinces to remain flexible with their itineraries as several air and ship may be either cancelled or indefinitely delayed when the typhoon comes ashore.
37,"-Impact-
--Philippines--
Nalgae, the second typhoon hit Philippines within one week made landfall along the coast of Dinapigue town in Isabela province."
38,"The PAGASA weather bureau chief Graciano Yumul said that ""The ground is still supersaturated and it cannot absorb more water."
39,"This will just flow down to rivers and towns, and there is a big possibility that landslides, flash flooding and flooding could occur."""
40,The search and rescue operations for Typhoon Nesat were halted because of the fierce weather brought by Nalgae.
41,"The NOLCOM chief Major General Jessie Dellosa said ""Our rescue operations are ongoing with the use of watercraft and rubber boats."
42,"We are also continuously coordinating with the local government units to rescue the affected residents in Calumpit and Hagonoy."""
43,The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council director Benito Ramos said that thousands of rescue workers were deployed across Luzon and the island's sparsely populated northeast coast was evacuated following the orders from the president Benigno Aquino III.
44,"Ramous said ""We're implementing persuasive evacuation operations."
45,"If I have to handcuff people to remove them from their homes I could be charged with human rights violations."""
