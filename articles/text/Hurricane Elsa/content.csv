0,Hurricane Elsa was a destructive tropical cyclone that affected many countries along its path during the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season.
1,"It was the earliest-forming fifth named storm on record in the Atlantic Ocean, and the first hurricane of the season."
2,"It formed over the central tropical Atlantic, farther east in the Main Development Region than any June storm at the time, except for the 1933 Trinidad hurricane."
3,"Originating from a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on June 27, the disturbance become organized as a tropical depression on June 30, about 1,150 mi(1,850 km) east-southeast of Barbados, and strengthened to a tropical storm soon thereafter."
4,"Then, riding the south edge of a strong subtropical ridge, Elsa moved swiftly westward on July 1, while rapidly intensifying."
5,"The storm strengthened to a hurricane around 12:00 UTC on July 2, as its center moved just south of Barbados, and then reached its peak intensity six hours later with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 85 mph(140 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 991 mbar(29.3 inHg), about 95 mi(155 km) west-northwest of Saint Vincent."
6,This made Elsa the strongest July hurricane recorded in the eastern Caribbean Sea since Emily in 2005.
7,"On July 3, Elsa weakened back into a tropical storm before slowing down by July 4, as it passed just north of Jamaica."
8,"On July 5, Elsa made landfall in Cuba, before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico early on the next day."
9,"It then paralleled the west coast of Florida, briefly becoming a minimal hurricane again as it passed west of Tampa, early on July 7."
10,"Elsa then weakened back to a tropical storm, before making landfall later that day in Taylor County, Florida, with maximum winds of about 65 mph(100 km/h)."
11,"Afterward, Elsa began accelerating northeastward across the southeast and Mid-Atlantic states, restrengthening slightly due to its proximity to the Atlantic."
12,"Elsa emerged back over water off New Jersey early on July 9, and moved over eastern Long Island and western Rhode Island, before becoming extratropical at 18:00 UTC that day, while moving through New England."
13,"Afterward, Elsa's extratropical remnant accelerated northeastward and slowly weakened."
14,The storm dissipated over Atlantic Canada on July 10.
15,"Altogether there were 13 deaths associated with Elsa: nine in the Florida Straits, two in the Dominican Republic, one in Martinique, and one in the United States."
16,"As Elsa raced past the Lesser Antilles, it caused extensive damage on several islands."
17,"In Barbados, the storm brought down trees, damaged roofs, caused widespread power outages, and caused flash flooding."
18,Its main impact in Cuba was flash flooding and mudslides.
19,"The storm caused widespread damage throughout the U.S., especially in the Northeast."
20,Atlantic Canada experienced many outages and high amounts of rainfall from a post-tropical Elsa.
21,"The storm dealt upwards of $1.2 billion in damages in the United States, with additional damage in the Caribbean."
22,"Upon its naming, Elsa received widespread social media attention, due to the storm sharing its name with the Disney character Elsa from the Frozen franchise."
23,"-Meteorological history-
On June 27, a tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa and tracked quickly westward across the Atlantic Ocean."
24,"The wave produced disorganized showers and thunderstorms during the next few days, before a closed and well-defined low pressure system developed by 18:00 UTC on June 30, marking the formation of a tropical depression about 1,150 mi(1,850 km) east-southeast of Barbados."
25,"The potential for tropical cyclone formation within the wave was first noted by the National Hurricane Center(NHC) at 12:00 UTC on June 29, and initially given a low(less than 40%) chance of development over the next five days."
26,The 5-day chance of formation was raised to high(greater than 60%) at 06:00 UTC on June 30.
27,"Later that day, after the system had moved to near the Lesser Antilles and was expected to become a tropical storm before reaching the islands, the disturbance was designated as Potential Tropical Cyclone Five at 21:00 UTC."
28,"However, the system became a tropical cyclone according to post-season analysis three hours before that initial advisory."
29,"The depression strengthened to a tropical storm by 00:00 UTC on July 1, while about 980 mi(1,575 km) east-southeast of Barbados, and named Elsa."
30,"This made Elsa the earliest fifth-named Atlantic storm in recorded history, surpassing Tropical Storm Edouard of 2020 by five days; it also became only the third tropical storm on record to form so early in the season east of 50°W, after the 1933 Trinidad hurricane and Tropical Storm Bret in 2023."
31,"Elsa became better organized, forming better-defined banding features on the western and southwestern portions of the storm."
32,"Well-defined upper-level outflow was produced on the western side of the cyclone, although outflow was ill-defined on the eastern half."
33,"Steered by a strong subtropical ridge to its north, the system moved swiftly westward at speeds of around 30 mph(45 km/h)."
34,"During the same period of time, Elsa began a period of rapid intensification."
35,"By early on July 2, microwave and radar data indicated that a small inner core had formed, and surface observations from the southern portion of Barbados, which was estimated to be within the radius of Elsa's maximum wind, reported sustained winds of 74 mph(119 km/h) and a gust to 86 mph(138 km/h), and Elsa strengthened to a hurricane as the center moved just south of Barbados around 12:00 UTC that day."
36,"The first hurricane of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, its formation came more than a month before the average appearance of the season's first hurricane."
37,"Six hours later, Elsa reached its peak intensity with maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 85 mph(140 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 991 mbar(29.3 inHg), while located about 95 mi(155 km) west-northwest of Saint Vincent."
38,This was the culmination of a 35 mph(55 km/h) intensification over a 24-hour period.
39,"Elsa's forward speed increased while it moved across the eastern and central Caribbean Sea early on July 3, but the low-level center became exposed to the west of the main area of deep convection, and it weakened into a tropical storm about 115 mi(185 km) south of the southern coast of the Dominican Republic."
40,"The storm continued to lose strength later that day and early on July 4, as the center passed offshore but near the mountainous terrain of southwestern Haiti and then just north of Jamaica."
41,"An Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft investigating Elsa late on July 4, found it to be undergoing a convective burst and beginning to restrengthen."
42,"At 18:00 UTC on July 5, Elsa made landfall on the south coast of Cuba in Cienaga de Zapata National Park with maximum winds of about 65 mph(100 km/h)."
43,"Several hours later, at 02:00 UTC on July 6, Elsa emerged into the Straits of Florida, where it began to regain its strength."
44,"The storm once more became a hurricane at 00:00 UTC on July 7, about 50 mi(80 km) west of Englewood, Florida, but weakened back into a tropical storm six hours later."
45,This weakening was likely caused by a combination of wind shear and an entrainment of dry air.
46,"Elsa then accelerated northward, and it made landfall in Taylor County, Florida, at 14:30 UTC that same day with maximum winds of about 65 mph(100 km/h)."
47,"Following landfall, Elsa turned northeastward and gradually began to weaken, though the storm continued to maintain tropical storm intensity."
48,"Most of its convection, however, was in a band in the eastern semicircle over the nearby Atlantic Ocean."
49,The center of the storm emerged over the Atlantic off New Jersey early on July 9.
50,"After moving northeastward and making landfall on eastern Long Island and western Rhode Island, Elsa became a post-tropical cyclone by 18:00 UTC that same day while over southeastern New England."
51,Elsa's extratropical remnant accelerated northeastward and slowly weakened.
52,The storm dissipated over Atlantic Canada before 12:00 UTC July 10.
