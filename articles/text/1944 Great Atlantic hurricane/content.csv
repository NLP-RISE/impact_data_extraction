0,The 1944 Great Atlantic hurricane was a destructive and powerful tropical cyclone that swept across a large portion of the United States East Coast in September 1944.
1,"New England was most affected, though so were the Outer Banks, Mid-Atlantic states, and the Canadian Maritimes."
2,"The storm's ferocity and path drew comparisons to the 1938 Long Island Express, one of the worst storms in New England history."
3,"Its precursor was first identified well east of the Lesser Antilles on September 4, but the disturbance only became well organized enough to be considered a tropical cyclone on September 9 northeast of the Virgin Islands."
4,"Tracking west-northwest, the storm gradually intensified, curved northward, and reached peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane on September 13 north of the Bahamas."
5,"A day later, the storm passed the Outer Banks and later made landfall on Long Island and Rhode Island as a weaker hurricane on September 15."
6,"The storm eventually became an extratropical cyclone, moving northeast, and merged with another extratropical system off Greenland on September 16."
7,"-Meteorological history-
The origins of the 1944 hurricane can be traced back to a tropical wave first identified well east of the Lesser Antilles on September 4."
8,"Over the next few days, the disturbance slowly traversed west-northwestward without producing any significant weather that would hint at tropical cyclogenesis."
9,"On September 7, an area of low pressure, albeit disorganized, formed in association with the tropical wave east of Barbados."
10,"The following day, the barometric depression became more well-defined, prompting the Weather Bureau in San Juan, Puerto Rico to issue advisories on the tropical disturbance."
11,"As a result of the sparseness of available surface observations east of the Lesser Antilles, a reconnaissance flight was dispatched to investigate the storm late on September 9; the flight reported that the disturbance had strengthened into a newly formed but fully-fledged hurricane."
12,"Due to the seemingly rapid development of the storm, the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project concluded that the storm likely began earlier and as a weaker system; thus, HURDAT—the official track database for hurricanes in the North Atlantic dating back to 1851—lists the tropical cyclone as having begun a tropical storm with winds of 50 mph(80 km/h) at 06:00 UTC on September 9."
13,"After formation, the tropical cyclone gradually intensified as it slowly moved west-northwestward, reaching the threshold for hurricane intensity at 06:00 UTC on September 10 while north of the Virgin Islands."
14,"Strengthening continued thereafter, and by September 12, the storm reached an intensity equivalent to a Category 3 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale."
15,"Later that day, the cyclone strengthened further into a Category 4-equivalent and was given the moniker of ""Great Atlantic hurricane"" by the Weather Bureau in Miami, Florida."
16,"Concurrently, the tropical cyclone began to curve and accelerate towards the north."
17,"At 06:00 UTC on September 13, the hurricane reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph(260 km/h),, and five hours later, a ship in the eye documented a minimum barometric pressure of 919 mbar(hPa; 27.14 inHg) alongside 15-knot(17 mph; 28 km/h) winds, suggesting a central pressure of 918 mbar(918 hPa; 27.1 inHg)."
18,"The storm's pressure may have been lower during its lifespan, though the 909 mbar(909 hPa; 26.8 inHg) pressure suggested by meteorologist Ivan Ray Tannehill was considered too low."
19,The hurricane began to gradually weaken after reaching peak intensity on September 13.
20,"In the morning hours of September 14, the storm passed just east of Cape Hatteras and eastern Virginia as a small but powerful hurricane with winds of 125 mph(201 km/h)."
21,"Afterwards, the cyclone curved slightly further towards the northeast and continued to accelerate; at 02:00 UTC on September 15, the hurricane made landfall near Southampton in eastern Long Island with winds of 105 mph(169 km/h)."
22,"The storm then crossed the island and Long Island Sound before making a second landfall two hours later near Point Judith, Rhode Island as a slightly weaker storm with winds of 100 mph(160 km/h)."
23,"After crossing Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the tropical system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone off the coast of Maine on September 15; these extratropical remnants continued to track towards the northeast and across the Canadian Maritimes before they were last noted merging with another extratropical cyclone off of Greenland at 12:00 UTC on September 16."
24,"-Preparations-
Upon being designated a tropical cyclone, the Weather Bureau began advising extreme caution to shipping within the expected path of the hurricane."
25,Precaution was also urged in the eastern Bahamas.
26,The first hurricane warning issued by the Weather Bureau in association with the storm was for the northern Bahamas on September 12.
27,"In Miami, Florida, the American Red Cross began preparing its resources for a potential regional calamity; however, the Weather Bureau did not necessarily anticipate the storm striking Miami."
28,Royal Air Force aircraft stationed in Nassau were flown to Miami in order to avoid the storm.
29,"Although tropical cyclone naming was not in practice at the time, the Weather Bureau in Miami, Florida, began naming the system the ""Great Atlantic hurricane"" in their public advisories on September 12 to better convey the life-threatening risks associated with the powerful hurricane."
30,"The following day, storm warnings were issued for areas from the United States East Coast from Savannah, Georgia to Cape Hatteras."
31,Small craft in offshore areas further south were advised to remain in port.
32,"As Morehead City, North Carolina was forecast to be submerged under several feet of water, the city's entire population was evacuated; other resort locales along the coast of North Carolina were also evacuated."
33,"Similarly, the 3000–4000 personnel constituting Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point were evacuated inland; U.S. Army and Navy aircraft were also sent inland."
34,"As the hurricane was passing near the Outer Banks, hurricane warnings were extended as far north as Portland, Maine, and storm warnings were issued as far north as Eastport, Maine."
35,Precautions across New England and Mid-Atlantic states began in earnest once the storm began tracking northwards.
36,"Sixty buses were readied in Ocean City, Maryland to evacuate the seaside resort's permanent and tourist residents."
37,"The 3,000 residents of Fire Island, one of the barrier islands off of Long Island, were ordered to evacuate the islet."
38,"Nearby, the Brooklyn Red Cross Chapter began readying for possible relief work, stocking five mobile canteens with emergency rations."
39,The United States First Naval District were directed to have personnel and rescue craft on standby to respond to emergencies.
40,The Massachusetts State Police began relaying Weather Bureau bulletins to local public services via telecommunications.
41,Personnel on duty were called back to barracks for later deployment in relief operations.
