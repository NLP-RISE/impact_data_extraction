161,"-Connection to global climate change-
The floods followed unprecedented heat waves in the Pacific Northwest and Northern Europe, prompting scientists to evaluate a possible connection to climate change."
162,"Prior to the floods, scientists had warned that extreme weather events would become more common as a consequence of climate change."
163,"Examples of such extreme events would include heavy rainfall; an increase in the atmosphere's temperature allows it to absorb more water vapour, resulting in more precipitation."
164,"Climate change might also have resulted in the jet stream becoming more erratic, which could lead to more frequent extreme weather phenomena."
165,Further research and analysis are needed to understand the extent of climate change's role in the floods.
166,"Antonio Navarra, climatologist at the University of Bologna and president of the Euro-Mediterranean Center Foundation on Climate Change, said that there is a clear correlation between the increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and the frequency and intensity of floods, heat waves and drought periods."
167,"Carl-FriCreedrich Schleussner of Humboldt-Universität Berlin said the question was not whether climate change had contributed to the event, but rather ""how much""."
168,"Dieter Gerten, a researcher from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, characterised the magnitude of the floods and other extreme weather events as exceeding predictions from current climate change models, noting that the abrupt increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather may indicate that a tipping point has been crossed."
169,"Michael E. Mann from Penn State University, Hayley Fowler of Newcastle University and Kai Kornhuber of Columbia University pointed to a slowing in the jet stream as a possible explanation."
170,"Stefan Rahmstorf of the University of Potsdam warned that further losses of Arctic ice would likely result in a weaker jet stream and more extreme weather, saying ""we should not play with this sensitive climate system""."
171,"In the aftermath of the flooding, a spokesperson of the World Meteorological Organization called for more action against climate change."
172,"On 13 July 2023, the European Union declared 15 July as the Annual EU Day for the Victims of the Global Climate Crisis, the date was chosen to commemorate the floods of 2021."
