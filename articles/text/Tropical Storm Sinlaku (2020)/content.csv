In late July 2020, an area of atmospheric convection began to persist approximately 410 km(255 mi) east of Virac, Catanduanes."
8,"Afterwards, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) designated the system a low-chance of developing into a tropical cyclone."

10,The low-pressure system then later left the Philippine Area of Responsibility and moved towards the South China Sea.
11,"By the following hours, the JTWC upgraded the disturbance's chance to develop at medium, assessing that the disturbance is a monsoon depression."
12,"On the following day, July 31, the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) designated the invest as a tropical depression."
13,"In a favorable environment of low vertical shear, excellent equatorial outflow and 31 °C sea surface temperatures, the depression continued to organize, and by the next day, the JMA upgraded depression to a tropical storm, naming it Sinlaku."
14,"The JTWC would later follow suit, upgrading the monsoon depression to tropical storm status."
15,"Sinlaku would later not intensify further, although the JMA said the storm's pressure lowered to 992 hPa(29.29 inHg)."
