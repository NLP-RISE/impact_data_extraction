0,"Tropical Storm Vicente was an unusually small tropical cyclone that made landfall as a tropical depression in the Mexican state of Michoacán on October 23, 2018, causing deadly mudslides."
1,"The 21st named storm of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season, Vicente originated from a tropical wave that departed from Africa's western coast on October 6."
2,The wave traveled westward across the Atlantic and entered the Eastern Pacific on October 17.
3,"The disturbance became better defined over the next couple of days, forming into a tropical depression early on October 19."
4,"Located in an environment favorable for further development, the system organized into Tropical Storm Vicente later that day."
5,The small cyclone traveled northwestward along the Guatemalan coast before later shifting to a more westerly track.
6,"Vicente peaked late on October 20 with winds of 50 mph(85 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1,002 mbar(29.59 inHg)."
7,"At its peak, Vicente displayed a sporadic eye feature in its central dense overcast."
8,The storm maintained this intensity for about eighteen hours as it turned towards the southwest.
9,Dry air caused Vicente to weaken on October 21.
10,A brief break from the dry air during the next day allowed the storm to recuperate and slightly strengthen.

20,"-Meteorological history-
Tropical Storm Vicente's origins can be traced back to a low-level vortex associated with the eastern Pacific monsoon trough and a tropical wave."
21,"The wave departed from Africa's western coast on October 6 and traveled westward across the Atlantic Ocean, arriving at the Lesser Antilles around October 14."
22,"Although convection or thunderstorm activity initially flared along the northern side of the wave, it gradually decreased until the wave was completely devoid of convection."
23,The wave came into contact with Central America on October 16; deep convection re-ignited along the monsoon trough and wave south of Panama a day later.
24,Bursts of convection occurred to the south of Nicaragua and El Salvador as the wave proceeded westward into the Eastern Pacific.
25,The National Hurricane Center(NHC) first mentioned that the system had the potential for tropical development early on October 19.
26,The system was part of a broader disturbance which stretched from Central America to the south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec.
27,"Over the next several hours the system rapidly organized, becoming a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC, while located about 90 mi(150 km) west-southwest of Puerto San Jose, Guatemala."
28,The depression's development was not anticipated due to its small size and the close proximity of a larger disturbance to the west(which later become Hurricane Willa).
29,"The nascent depression was located in an environment of low wind shear and warm 82–84 °F(28–29 °C) sea surface temperatures, both conducive for further intensification."
30,"The structure of the unusually small storm continued to improve, with satellite and microwave imagery showing an increase in banding features around the center."
31,The depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Vicente around 18:00 UTC.
32,"Throughout the majority of October 19, the system was less than 115 mi(185 km) off the coast of Guatemala while it inched towards the northwest."
33,"Early on October 20, increasing northwesterly wind shear disrupted Vicente, causing the degradation of its central dense overcast."
34,"At the same time, its low-level center had accelerated towards the northwest and was almost entirely exposed."
35,"A deep-layer ridge located over the Gulf of Mexico and central Mexico, as well as a Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind, caused Vicente's track to shift to the west during the overnight."
36,"The tiny tropical cyclone's structure improved over the next several hours, with the storm displaying a sporadic eye feature surrounded by medium to weak convection."
37,"Vicente peaked at 18:00 UTC on October 20 with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph(85 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1,002 mbar(29.59 inHg)."
38,"At that time, the storm was located less than 115 mi(185 km) off the coast of Chiapas and Oaxaca, Mexico."
39,"Vicente was an unusually small tropical cyclone, with 45–50 mph(70–80 km/h) winds extending only 25 mi(35 km) from its center."
40,The system maintained its peak intensity for approximately 18 hours as it began traveling towards the west-southwest.
41,"Dry air began to entrain into the mid-levels of the system on October 21, causing convection to weaken and the low-level center to become uncovered once more."
42,The storm turned to the west-northwest early on October 22 as it rounded the southwestern edge of the aforementioned ridge.
43,The structure of Vicente markedly improved while it experienced a brief reprieve from the onslaught of the dry air; a banding feature with cold cloud tops of −112 °F(−80 °C) developed and wrapped around a majority of the storm.
44,"Later in the day, Vicente began to be affected by the outflow of Hurricane Willa, which was located to the northwest."
45,"This outflow imparted northeasterly shear upon Vicente, causing rapid degradation of the system's structure."
46,"Banding features decreased significantly and only limited convection remained, displaced to the south and east of Vicente's center."
47,"Vicente weakened into a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on October 23 and made landfall near Playa Azul, Michoacán, at 13:30 UTC."
48,"After moving ashore, Vicente quickly lost its convection and dissipated by 18:00 UTC."
