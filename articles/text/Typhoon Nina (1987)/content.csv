0,"Typhoon Nina, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Sisang, was the most intense typhoon to strike the Philippines since Typhoon Irma in 1981."
1,Typhoon Nina originated from an area of convection near the Marshall Islands in mid-November 1987.
2,"It gradually became better organized, and on November 19, was first classified as a tropical cyclone."
3,"Moving west-northwest, Nina attained tropical storm intensity that evening."
4,"Late on November 20, Nina passed through the Chuuk Lagoon in the Federated States of Micronesia."
5,"After a brief pause in intensification, Nina intensified into a typhoon on November 22."
6,"Two days later, the typhoon intensified suddenly, before attaining its peak 10 minute intensity of 165 km/h(105 mph; 90 kn)."
7,"During the afternoon of November 25, Nina moved ashore in Southern Luzon at the same intensity."
8,"It gradually weakened over land, before entering the South China Sea and turning to the north."
9,"By November 30, Nina dissipated."
10,"Across the Chuuk Lagoon, four people were killed and damage ranged from $30–$40 million(1987 USD)."
11,"In the capital of Weno, 85% of dwellings and 50% of government buildings were damaged."
12,"Throughout the atoll, at least 1,000 people were rendered homeless, approximately 1,000 houses were damaged, and 39 injuries were reported."
13,"While crossing the Philippines, Nina brought extensive damage to the northern portion of the island group."
14,"The town of Matnog sustained the worst damage from the typhoon, where 287 people died."
15,"Sixty-one people died in the city of Sorsogon, where 98% of all structures were either damaged or destroyed."
16,"Four hundred people died, 80% of all crops were destroyed, and 90% of all homes were either damaged or destroyed in the Sorsogon province."
17,"Nearby, in the Albay province, 73 people were killed."
18,"Throughout both the Albay and Sorsogon provinces, four-fifths of all schools and half of all public infrastructure were destroyed."
19,"Elsewhere, in Boac, 80% of homes lost their roofs."
20,"In Bacacay, 18 of the village's 200 homes were destroyed."
21,"However, the capital city of Manila avoided the brunt of the typhoon."
22,"Throughout the Philippines, approximately 114,000 people sought shelter, approximately 90,000 houses were destroyed, leaving more than 150,000 homeless."
23,"Nationwide, damage from the storm totaled $54.5 million and 979 people perished."
24,"-Meteorological history-
An area of convection developed within near the Marshall Islands in mid-November."
25,"Initially, convection waxed and waned, but on November 17, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) started tracking the system."
26,"At this time, the system developed deep convection as well as good outflow."
27,The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert(TCFA) at 0100 UTC on November 19 due to a significant increase in organization.
28,"Five hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) started monitoring the system."
29,"Continuing to rapidly become better organized while moving west-northwest, the cyclone was classified as a tropical depression by the JTWC at midday."
30,"On the evening of November 19, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded the system to Tropical Storm, prompting JTWC to name the system as Nina, shortly after developing banding features."
31,"Initially forecast by the JTWC to move slowly, instead, Nina accelerated while gradually intensifying."
32,"At 1600 UTC on November 20, Tropical Storm Nina passed 75 km(45 mi; 40 nmi) south of Weno Island in the Chuuk Lagoon."
33,"Two hours later, the JMA upgraded Nina to a severe tropical storm."
34,"After moving away from the island on the morning of November 21, the JTWC upgraded Nina to a typhoon at 1200 UTC, with the JMA following suit early on November 22."
35,"Shortly thereafter, Nina made its closest approach to Ulithi, passing 110 km(70 mi; 60 nmi) to the north."
36,"At 1600 UTC, Nina tracked about 175 km(110 mi; 95 nmi) north of Yap."
37,Typhoon Nina accelerated slightly as it traversed the open waters of the Philippine Sea.
38,"The storm continued to slowly deepen, though early on November 23, the system leveled off in intensity."
39,"That day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration(PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Sisang, upon entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility."
40,"However, midday on November 24, Nina entered a phase of explosive intensification, at a rate of 1.33 mbar(0.039 inHg) an hour."
41,"Despite this, the JMA only increased the intensity slightly to 170 km/h(105 mph; 90 kn)."
42,"After developing a well-defined eye, the JTWC reported that Nina attained its peak intensity of 270 km/h(170 mph; 145 kn), making it a low-end Category 5 system on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale."
43,"At 1500 UTC on November 25, Nina moved ashore as it made landfall along the southern tip of Luzon at its peak intensity."
44,"Despite land interaction, little change in strength occurred until 0000 UTC on November 26, at that time, the system began to weaken."
45,"After traversing Luzon and Mindoro, the JTWC reduced the wind speed of the typhoon to 110 mph(175 km/h; 95 kn)."
46,"Although no eye was visible on satellite imagery, radar imagery indicated that an eye was present, but cloud-filed; henceforth, the JTWC increased the intensity of Nina to 185 km/h(115 mph; 100 kn), equivalent to a weak Category 3 hurricane."
47,"According to the JMA, however, Nina never re-intensified."
48,"By 0000 UTC on November 27, the low and mid level circulations began to decouple, deeply thwarting many JTWC forecasters."
49,"During this time, the cyclone posed a serious threat to Southern China and Hong Kong; but instead, Nina veered northward while gradually weakening; by midday on November 27, the JMA had reduced the intensity of Nina to 130 km/h(80 mph; 70 kn)."
50,"Early on November 28, an eye once again became visible on satellite imagery."
51,"However, no re-intensification occurred."
52,"By the afternoon, increased wind shear took toll on the cyclone, causing Nina to become less organized due to deep convection being sheared off to the east-northeast."
53,"Thus, the JTWC expected Nina to move into the Luzon Straits and rapidly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone."
54,"After meandering within the South China Sea, Nina turned south, before dissipating on November 29; though, the JMA continued to monitor its remnants until 0000 UTC on November 30."
55,"-Preparation and impact-
