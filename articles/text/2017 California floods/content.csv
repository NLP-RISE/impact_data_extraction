8,Another feature in the 2013–2015 winters was the extreme temperature contrast between a warm western U.S. and a cold eastern continent.
9,"These anomalous temperature and circulation patterns were referred to as the North American winter )
        .replace(""”"", dipole”."
10,"The dipole basically describes the wintertime stationary waves over North America, which contribute to the mean temperature difference between the climatologically warmer western U.S. and colder eastern half."
11,"Therefore, an amplification of the stationary wave would enhance such a temperature difference, like in the 2013-2015 winters, while a weakening of the stationary wave would reverse the situation, like in the 2016–2017 winter."
