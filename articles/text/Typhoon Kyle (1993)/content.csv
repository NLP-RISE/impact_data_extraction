4,"Upon entering the South China Sea, the system strengthened to a severe tropical storm before rapidly intensifying to a typhoon, three days later."
5,"It soon reached its peak intensity that day, with one-minute maximum sustained winds of 175 km/h(110 mph), equivalent to a mid-level Category 2 typhoon."
6,It held its strength until landfall in Vietnam later that evening.
7,"Weakening through the mountainous terrain of the country, it dissipated near the Cambodiaâ€“Thailand border on November 24."
8,"The typhoon caused over 106 confirmed deaths, mainly are from Vietnam."
9,"Landslides and large swaths of flash floods are also seen and reported, as far as Thailand."

13,The Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) of Japan also started to mention the disturbance in their bulletins at that time.
14,The disturbance had blossoming convection around its disorganized low-level circulation center at that time.
15,"It slowly moved to the west-northwest while slowly organizing, behind a favorable environment of low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures."

17,"Roughly six hours later, the agency upgraded the system to a tropical depression without issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert due to the system quickly developing."
18,"At 18:00 UTC that day, the system attained a tight convective curvature, leading the JTWC to upgrade the system to a tropical storm and named it Kyle."
19,The JMA also issued their first advisory on Kyle as a tropical storm at the same time.
20,"The system became slightly disorganized as it started to approach the Philippines due to wind shear, but still continued to organize despite the environment."
21,"Early the next day, it passed to the south of Homonhon Island while traversing Leyte Gulf before making landfall on Abuyog, Leyte between 03:00 and 06:00 UTC as a minimal storm, with 65 km/h(40 mph) winds."

28,A small and elongated eye also emerged at this time.
29,"Early the next day, Kyle further strengthened to a mid-level typhoon and reached its peak intensity of 175 km/h(110 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 960 mbar, while approaching the coast of Vietnam on November 23."
30,"It held this intensity until it slightly weakened before its final landfall on the country, 380 km to the northeast of Ho Chi Minh City on the evening of the same day."
31,It rapidly weakened as it traversed Vietnam before entering the nearby Cambodia as a tropical depression.
32,The last warning was issued by the JMA and JTWC as Kyle dissipated near the Cambodia-Thailand border on November 24.
