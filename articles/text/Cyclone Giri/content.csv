0,"Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Giri()(IMD designation: BOB 04, JTWC designation 04B, also known as Cyclone Giri) was a powerful tropical cyclone in terms of 1-minute sustained wind speed which caused catastrophic damage in parts of Myanmar in late October 2010."
1,"Originating from an area of low pressure over the Bay of Bengal on October 19, the system began as a weak depression 250 km(155 mi) south of Myanmar."
2,"Over the following few days, the depression underwent explosive intensification, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 195 km/h(120 mph 3-minute sustained) on October 22."
3,"Cyclone Giri made landfall roughly 50 km(31 mi) northwest of Kyaukpyu, shortly after peaking."
4,"Within hours of moving onshore, the system had substantially weakened."
5,"By the following day, Giri had degenerated into a tropical depression and the final advisory was issued on the storm."
6,"Unlike during Cyclone Nargis in 2008, the Government of Myanmar took steps to ensure the safety of residents in the path of Cyclone Giri."

10,An international relief effort began shortly after the storm passed to assist survivors of the storm.
11,"Local and foreign media initially criticized the Myanmar government for not giving residents enough warning of the storm and then for keeping quiet on the situation, but the focus later shifted to the loss of life and relief efforts."
12,"-Meteorological history-
Cyclone Giri was first identified by the India Meteorological Department(IMD) as an area of low pressure over the Bay of Bengal on October 19."
13,"Early on October 20, the system was classified as a depression and given the name BOB 04; and at that time, the system was situated roughly 250 km(155 mi) southwest of Sittwe, Myanmar."
14,Continued development took place as convection consolidated around the system and banding features formed along the western side of the low.
15,"As the depression was situated in an area of weak wind shear, further development was anticipated over the following days."
16,"Early on October 21, the IMD upgraded the system to a deep depression and expected it to further intensify into a cyclonic storm within 24 hours."
17,"Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) issued their first advisory on the depression, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 04B. The system rapidly developed throughout the day on October 21, developing an eye embedded within deep convection."
18,"In response to a near-equatorial ridge to the south, the system slowly tracked towards the northeast, placing Myanmar within its path."
19,"Around 0600 UTC, the IMD upgraded the system to a cyclonic storm, assigning it the name ""Giri""."
20,"Tracking over an area of high sea surface temperatures, rapid intensification ensued during the latter half of October 21."
21,"Following the development of very intense convection, with estimated cloud top temperatures between −70 and −80 °C(−94 and −112 °F), Giri strengthened into a severe cyclonic storm, having sustained winds of at least 95 km/h(60 mph 3-minute sustained)."
22,"Around 1800 UTC, the JTWC estimated that the system intensified into a Category 1 equivalent cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale."
23,"Early on October 22, Giri further strengthened into a very severe cyclonic storm as it slowly moved towards the central coast of Myanmar."
24,"Throughout the day, the storm underwent explosive deepening, attaining winds of 240 km/h(145 mph 1-minute sustained) by 0900 UTC."
25,Satellite imagery depicted a well-defined 46 km(29 mi) wide eye surrounded by deep convection.
26,"Accompanied by strong poleward outflow, additional strengthening took place despite Giri's proximity to land."
27,"In the hours before landfall on October 22, Giri attained its peak intensity with winds of 165 km/h(105 mph 3-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 950 mbar(hPa; 28.05 inHg)."
28,"However, the JTWC estimated that Giri was a substantially stronger storm, nearly attaining Category 5 status; peak winds were believed to have reached 250 km/h(155 mph 1-minute sustained) along with an estimated pressure of 922 mbar(hPa; 27.23 inHg)."
29,"Around 1400 UTC, Cyclone Giri made landfall near Hunter's Bay, roughly 50 km(31 mi) northwest of Kyaukpyu at peak intensity."
30,"Upon doing so, Giri became the most intense storm to ever strike Myanmar, surpassing Cyclone Nargis which struck the Irrawaddy Delta region as a low-end Category 4 equivalent in May 2008."
31,"However, according to the International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies, substantial weakening had taken place within the hours before landfall; they estimated that Cyclone Giri struck the coastline with winds of 175 km/h(110 mph 1-minute sustained)."
32,"Once overland, the cyclone rapidly decayed as convection dissipated."
33,"By early October 23, only scattered bursts of convection remained around the center of Giri as it degenerated into a tropical depression."
34,The final advisory from the IMD was issued later that day as the system weakened further.
35,"-Preparations-
Shortly after Giri was classified a very severe cyclonic storm, warnings were issued for the coastline of Myanmar."
36,"Relative to the storm's intensity, preparations were minimal; however, this was because forecasters did not anticipate Giri to strengthen as quickly as it did."
37,The greatest fear of the residents was the aftermath of the storm.
38,"There were concerns that the cyclone could cause devastation similar to that of Cyclone Nargis in May 2008 which killed an estimated 140,000 people in the Irrawaddy Delta."
39,"The chief of the Myanmar Climate Change Watch, a branch within the Myanmar Meteorology and Hydrology Department, urged people to move to higher grounds and into sturdy buildings as a storm surge up to 3.6 m(12 ft) was anticipated."
