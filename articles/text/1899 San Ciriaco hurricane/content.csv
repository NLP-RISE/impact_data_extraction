222,Davis ordered that commanding officers assess damage in each district and report the number of citizens without food and shelter.
223,"Hundreds submitted petitions for tax relief, including 369 in Lares alone."
224,"The destruction of infrastructure made it difficult to deliver aid, especially because of an 11 mi(18 km) section of railroad destroyed between Añasco and Mayagüez."
225,Many roads and bridges were rebuilt in the following months.
226,"However, because the railroads were privately owned, the government hesitated to begin repairs."
227,Various municipal governments proposed 25 million to 30 million pesos in bonds to fund restoration efforts.
228,"On August 24, the USAT McClellan departed the United States Quartermaster's dock in Brooklyn after being filled with supplies by the Puerto Rican Relief Committee of the Merchant's Association including 12,600 vests for women, 4,800 women's wrappers, 4,200 undershirts for men, 600 pairs of trousers, and 215 children's garments."

235,"Additionally, the Imperial Lighthouse Service issued a set of signal flags to all lighthouses in the Bahamas."
236,"There was so much Destruction in Diamond City, North Carolina that the approximately 500 residents of the settlement and island decided to move inland."

238,Hurricane San Ciriaco set many records on its path.
239,"Resulting in at least 3,369 deaths in Puerto Rico, the storm was the deadliest hurricane to hit the island and the strongest at the time, until the Hurricane San Felipe Segundo made landfall in 1928 as a Category 5 hurricane."
240,It was also among the deadliest Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded.
241,"Also, with an accumulated cyclone energy of 73.57, it has the highest ACE of any Atlantic hurricane in history and was second highest overall, until surpassed by 2023's Cyclone Freddy."
242,"In 2004, Hurricane Ivan became the second Atlantic hurricane to surpass an ACE value of 70, but did not surpass the San Ciriaco hurricane."

245,"Two historians, living in Hawaii, documented the history of Puerto Rican migration to Hawaii and stated the San Ciriaco hurricane was one of the main reasons why Puerto Ricans went to Hawaii."
246,"""Nicolas G. Vegas wrote in his Narración Patriótica(Patriotic Narration):
-Name-
The hurricane earned its name by striking Puerto Rico on August 8, the Roman Catholic feast day devoted to Saint Cyriacus(San Ciriaco in Spanish)."
247,"This was a common practice prior to the introduction of standardized hurricane names – for example, the 1867 San Narciso hurricane, the 1928 San Felipe hurricane, and the 1932 San Ciprian hurricane were also named after the feast day on which they occurred."
