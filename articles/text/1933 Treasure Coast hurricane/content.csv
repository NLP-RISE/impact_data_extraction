0,The 1933 Treasure Coast hurricane was the second-most intense tropical cyclone to strike the United States during the active 1933 Atlantic hurricane season.
1,"The eleventh tropical storm, fifth hurricane, and the third major hurricane of the season, it formed east-northeast of the Leeward Islands on August 31."
2,"The tropical storm moved rapidly west-northwestward, steadily intensifying to a hurricane."
3,"It acquired peak winds of 140 mph(220 km/h) and passed over portions of the Bahamas on September 3, including Eleuthera and Harbour Island, causing severe damage to crops, buildings, and infrastructure."
4,"Winds over 100 mph(160 km/h) affected many islands in its path, especially those that encountered its center, and many wharves were ruined."
5,"Subsequently, it weakened and made landfall at Jupiter, Florida, early on September 4 with winds of 125 mph(205 km/h)."
6,"The hurricane moved across the state, passing near Tampa before moving into Georgia and dissipating."
7,"In Florida, the strong winds of the cyclone blew buildings off their foundations, and numerous trees were prostrated in citrus groves."
8,"The Treasure Coast region received the most extensive destruction, and Stuart, Jupiter, and Fort Pierce were heavily damaged."
9,The storm was locally regarded as the most severe on record in 50 years.
10,"Inland, the cyclone weakened rapidly but produced prodigious amounts of rain, causing a dam to collapse near Tampa."
11,"The storm caused $3 million in damage(1933 USD) after damaging or destroying 6,848 homes."
12,"Unusually, the storm hit Florida less than 24 hours before another major hurricane bearing 125-mph(205-km/h) winds struck South Texas; never have two major cyclones hit the United States in such close succession."
13,"-Meteorological history-
The origins of the hurricane were from a tropical wave that possibly spawned a tropical depression on August 27, although there was minimal data over the next few days as it tracked to the west-northwest."
14,"On August 31, a nearby ship reported gale-force winds, which indicated that a tropical storm had developed to the east-northeast of the Lesser Antilles."
15,"Based on continuity, it is estimated the storm attained hurricane status later that day."
16,"Moving quickly to the west-northwest, the storm passed north of the Lesser Antilles and Puerto Rico."
17,"Early on September 2, a ship called the Gulfwing reported a barometric pressure of 978 mb(28.9 inHg), which confirmed that the storm attained hurricane status."
18,"After passing north of the Turks and Caicos islands, the hurricane struck Eleuthera and Harbour Island in the Bahamas on September 3, the latter at 11:00 UTC."
19,A station on the latter island reported a pressure of 27.90 inHg(945 mb) during the half-hour-long passage of the eye.
20,"Based on the pressure and the small size of the storm, it is estimated the hurricane struck Harbour Island with peak winds of 140 mph(220 km/h), making it the equivalent of a modern Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale."
21,"Interpolation suggested that the storm reached major hurricane status, or Category 3 status, on September 2."
22,"The hurricane initially followed the course of another hurricane that passed through the area in late August, which ultimately struck Cuba and Texas."
23,This hurricane instead maintained a general west-northwest track.
24,"After moving through the northern Bahamas, the hurricane weakened slightly before making landfall at Jupiter, Florida, at 05:00 UTC on September 4."
25,A station there reported a pressure of 27.98 inHg(948 mb) during a 40-minute period of the eye's passage; this suggested a landfall strength of 125 mph(205 km/h).
26,"At the time, the radius of maximum winds was an estimated 15 nmi(15 mi, 30 km), which was smaller than average."
27,"After landfall, the hurricane weakened rapidly while crossing the state."
28,It briefly emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm early on September 5.
29,"A few hours later while continuing to the northwest, it made another landfall near Rosewood—a ghost town in Levy County, east of Cedar Key—with winds of about 65 mph(100 km/h)."
30,"Turning to the north, the storm slowly weakened as it crossed into Georgia, dissipating on September 7 near Augusta."
31,"-Preparations-
On September 2, a fleet of eight aircraft evacuated all white residents from West End, Grand Bahama, to Daytona Beach, Florida."
32,"While the storm was near peak intensity on September 3, the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings from Miami to Melbourne, Florida, with storm warnings extending northward to Jacksonville."
33,"Later that day, storm warnings, were issued from Key West to Cedar Key."
34,"About 2,500 people evacuated by train from areas around Lake Okeechobee."
35,"By evening on September 3, high tides sent sea spray over coastal seawalls in Palm Beach County as residents boarded up buildings; structures on Clematis Street in West Palm Beach were said to be a ""solid front"" of plywood."
36,"Along the coast, observers reported very rough seas as the eye neared land."

49,"--Florida--
When the storm moved ashore in Florida, winds reached an estimated 125 mph(200 km/h) in Jupiter; these occurred after the eye passed."
50,"In West Palm Beach, anemometers measured at least 80-mile-per-hour(130 km/h) winds with gusts to 100 mph(160 km/h); barometers ranged from 28.64 to 28.78 inHg(970 to 975 mb)."
51,The storm produced the strongest winds in the city since the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane.

64,Some homes that lost roofing shingles had water damage to their interiors as well.
65,"Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive breakage of windows, including plate glass, and loss of tile and shingle roofing, but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars, and no post-storm accidents took place."
66,"Strong winds snapped many light poles in the city, and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted."
67,"As in Lake Worth, officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage."
