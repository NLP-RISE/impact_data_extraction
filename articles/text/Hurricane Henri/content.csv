0,Hurricane Henri( ahn-REE) was a tropical cyclone that impacted the Northeastern United States.
1,"The eighth named storm and third hurricane of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, Henri developed from a well-defined low-pressure system north-northeast of Bermuda, becoming a tropical depression on August 16."
2,"Nearly a day later, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Henri."
3,"Henri continued to move south, and later southwest before strengthening steadily, reaching its initial peak intensity with winds of 70 mph(110 km/h) and a pressure of 994 mbar(29.4 inHg) early on August 19."
4,"Soon after, strong wind shear weakened Henri slightly."
5,"Eventually, on August 21, Henri strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane, before weakening back to a tropical storm and making landfall in Westerly, Rhode Island, on August 22, making it the second tropical cyclone to make landfall in the U.S. state of Rhode Island during the season, seven weeks after Elsa."
6,"It proceeded to move west-northwestward, weakening into a tropical depression while slowing down later that day."
7,"On August 23, Henri degenerated into a remnant low over New England, before dissipating the next day over the Atlantic."
8,"Despite its relatively weak intensity, the storm brought very heavy rainfall over the Northeastern United States and New England, causing widespread flooding in many areas, including cities such as New York and Boston."
9,"Power outages became extensive in the region, while wind damage was sparse in comparison."
10,"In the aftermath of Henri, many crews were put in place from around the United States to help with recovery efforts and rescues."
11,"The storm caused less damage overall than initially feared, due to a weaker landfall and faster weakening trend compared to what was previously forecast."
12,"Henri continued to drop large amounts of rain as it weakened over land, prolonging floods and power outages."
13,Henri killed two people and caused an estimated $700 million(2021 USD) in damage.
14,"-Meteorological history-
A cluster of thunderstorms associated with a mid-level disturbance emerged off the U.S. Mid-Atlantic coast between late on August 11 and early the following day."
15,"The disturbance generated a weak surface trough on August 14, which by the end of that day developed into a surface low pressure area about 230 mi(370 km) north-northeast of Bermuda."
16,"That same day, the National Hurricane Center(NHC) mentioned the weather system as an area of potential tropical cyclogenesis, as the low drifted southward."
17,The thunderstorms became more organized on August 15.
18,"In the early hours of August 16, the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Eight, while it was located about 135 mi(217 km) east-northeast of Bermuda."
19,Warm sea surface temperatures favorable for the system's development were counteracted by northerly wind shear.
20,"The nascent depression moved slowly southwestward, steered around a ridge off the coast of the Eastern United States."
21,"Later that day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Henri, after the storm's deep convection organized further near the center."
22,"By August 17, Henri moved westward, toward the Eastern United States."
23,"Its convection evolved into curved rainbands, and an eye feature was evident in the storm on Bermuda radar; however, it was still affected by wind shear at the time."
24,The shear and dry air caused the storm's structure to deteriorate on August 19.
25,"On August 20, Henri turned towards the north, steering by an approaching trough over the Appalachians and a building ridge to the northeast of the storm."
26,"On August 21, at 15:00 UTC, Henri became a Category 1 hurricane after reconnaissance aircraft found hurricane-force winds."
27,"It would maintain hurricane intensity for another day, before weakening back to a high-end tropical storm at 11:00 UTC on August 22, as it approached southern New England."
28,"The storm made landfall on August 22, in Westerly, Rhode Island, around 16:15 UTC, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph(95 km/h)."
29,"The storm rapidly weakened into a tropical depression early the next day, before becoming post-tropical."
