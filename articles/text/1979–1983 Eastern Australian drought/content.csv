3,1978 was especially wet in the southern coast districts of New South Wales and East Gippsland because southern low pressure systems consistently redeveloped over the east coast.
4,"Orbost's 1978 rainfall of 1,559 millimetres(61.4 in) is as much as 256 mm(10 inches) above its previous record from 1935."

13,"February and March saw a continuing powerful monsoon, but except for the Mallee in February and the east coast from Newcastle to Triabunna in March, southeastern Australia was dry."

25,"April began very warm and dry, but an extensive upper low followed by a vigorous cold front on the 22nd made this an extremely wet month in South Australia, far western New South Wales, western Victoria and northern Tasmania."
26,"However, in most of New South Wales this blocking high produced uninterrupted dry weather."

31,"Elsewhere in eastern Australia the winter had near normal rainfall but was exceptionally warm, while September's dryness extended to every part of the mainland except alpine areas and the southern coastline, where the mild, wet weather was producing good conditions despite the burden of agisting cattle from drought-stricken areas."
32,"Although October was very wet in South Australia, western Victoria, and southern Queensland, drought-affected areas of New South Wales did not get significant rain until December, when hot, humid and unsettled weather brought some relief from the driest February to November period over the southeast corner since 1915."
