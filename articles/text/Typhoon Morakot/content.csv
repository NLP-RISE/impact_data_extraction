22,"-Meteorological history-
Early on August 2, 2009, the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) reported that a tropical depression had formed within a monsoon trough located about 1,000 km(620 mi) east of Luzon, However the depression remained weak and was downgraded to an area of low pressure, before regenerating later that day."
23,"Both the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration(PAGASA) then started to monitor the depression early the next day, while it was located about 700 km(430 mi) to the southeast of Okinawa, Japan, with the PAGASA assigning the name Kiko to the depression."
24,"The JTWC reported at this time that the storm consisted of an area of convection, with deep convection flaring on the western side of a partially exposed low-level circulation center."
25,"Later on August 3, the JMA reported that the depression had intensified into a tropical storm, and gave it the name  Morakot."
26,"The JTWC further designated the system as Tropical Depression 09W, as deep convection had increased over the low-level circulation center, and the agency reported that the storm was moving around a low-level ridge of high pressure, which was located to the east of the Morakot's low-level circulation center."
27,"On the morning of August 4, the JTWC reported that the Morakot had steadily intensified into a tropical storm, as 1-minute sustained wind speeds were estimated to be near 65 km/h(40 mph), with deep convective banding building toward the low-level circulation center, under the influence of a subtropical ridge located to the east of the system."
28,"Later that day, the JMA reported that Morakot had intensified into a severe tropical storm, before it was upgraded to a typhoon by both the JMA and the JTWC early the next day."
29,"Initially, the JTWC anticipated that Morakot would intensify into a powerful typhoon while approaching China, peaking as a Category 4-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale(SSHWS)."
30,"However, due to the size of the typhoon, while the barometric pressure steadily decreased, the maximum winds only increased slightly."
31,"Early on August 7, the storm attained its peak intensity, with a central minimum pressure of 945 millibars(27.9 inHg) and maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 140 km/h(85 mph), according to the JMA."
32,"The JTWC reported the storm to be slightly stronger, with maximum 1-minute winds peaking at 150 km/h(90 mph), the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale."
33,"Morakot's forward motion slowed, and the storm weakened slightly before making landfall in central Taiwan later that day, as a severe tropical storm."
34,"Roughly 24 hours later, the storm emerged back over water into the Taiwan Strait and turned northward, before making landfall in Mainland China on August 9, as a severe tropical storm."
35,"The storm gradually weakened as it continued to slowly track inland, with the storm's forward motion gradually increasing, with the system eventually turning northeastward on August 11."
36,"Later that day, Morakot degenerated into a remnant low in the East China Sea, before making landfall on South Korea early on the next day, and then making another landfall on northern Japan on August 13."
