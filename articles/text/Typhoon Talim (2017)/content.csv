0,"Typhoon Talim, known in the Philippines as Typhoon Lannie, was an intense and destructive tropical cyclone that affected parts of East Asia, especially Japan, during mid-September 2017."
1,"The eighteenth named storm and the sixth typhoon of the 2017 Pacific typhoon season, Talim's origins can be traced back to an area of low-pressure that the Joint Typhoon Warning Center first monitored on September 6."
2,"The disturbance was upgraded to a tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency only two days later, and it became a tropical storm on September 9, earning the name Talim."
3,"Talim grew stronger over the next few days, eventually becoming a typhoon the next day."
4,"Within a favorable environment, the typhoon rapidly intensified after passing through the Ryukyu Islands."
5,"However, as it moved eastward, Talim started to weaken due to wind shear, and on September 16, it was downgraded to a tropical storm."
6,"The storm passed over Japan, near Kyushu the next day, before becoming extratropical on September 18."
7,"The extratropical remnants were last noted by the JMA four days later, before dissipating fully on September 22."
8,"In preparations for the typhoon, more than a half a million individuals evacuated in the Japanese islands, and tropical cyclone alerts were raised in the country itself, Taiwan and the eastern portion of China."
9,"The NDRRMC in the Philippines also issued bulletins on the system, depicting a possibility of flash floods and landslides in Luzon; however, the typhoon passed safely to the east of the country."
10,"5 deaths were attributed from Talim, all in Japan and caused over $750 million worth of damages over the country."
11,"-Meteorological history-
On September 6, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began monitoring a low pressure area for potential tropical cyclogenesis, under a favorable environment."
12,"Two days later, on September 8, the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) confirmed the formation of a tropical depression to the southeast of the Mariana Islands."
13,"A ridge steered the depression to the northwest to more favorable conditions, including low wind shear, warm sea surface temperatures and good outflow."
14,"On the same day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) followed suit, recognizing it as a tropical depression in their first bulletin."
15,"The depression continued intensifying, becoming a tropical storm, early the next day, according to the JMA, and gave the name Talim on the system."
16,The JTWC followed upgrading the system on the afternoon hours of the same day.
17,"The next day, it strengthened further to a severe tropical storm in the Philippine Sea."
18,"In the early morning hours of September 10, the JMA upgraded the system to a typhoon, with a small eye emerging on the system."
19,"Its eye became apparent on satellite images later that day, before Talim entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility, with the PAGASA issuing on their first bulletin, classifying the system as Typhoon Lannie."
20,It passed over the Ryukyu Islands on September 13 as it continued to move to the northwest.
21,"Also at that time, Lannie exited the PAR, with the PAGASA issuing their final advisory on the system."
22,"Talim reached its peak strength the next day, with sustained winds of about 140 mph(230 km/h) for one minute mean and a minimum pressure of 935 mbar(27.61 inHg)."
23,"At this time, the typhoon's wind field expanded as far as Shanghai and it featured a large eye."
24,"On September 15, Talim began to weaken due to increasing upper-level wind shear, with the typhoon becoming slowly disorganized."
25,"It further degraded to a tropical storm as it slowly approached the Japanese Islands, before making landfall near Kyushu on September 17."
26,"It crossed the country, before transitioning to an extratropical storm as it entered the Sea of Japan, near Hokkaido on the next day, following with the JTWC and JMA issuing their final warning."
27,It soon hit Sakhalin as a gale-force extratropical storm later that day.
28,"The extratropical remnants persisted for four more days before dissipating on September 22, just offshore Magadan Oblast."
