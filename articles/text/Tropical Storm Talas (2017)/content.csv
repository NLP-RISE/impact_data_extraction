18,"At 09:00 UTC, the JMA upgraded the storm to a severe tropical storm after it attained 10-minute sustained winds of 95 km/h(59 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 985 hPa(29.1 inHg), reaching its peak intensity."
19,"At the same time, the JTWC recorded one-minute sustained peak winds of 95 km/h(59 mph) while trailing along Hainan."
20,"Shortly thereafter, Talas began to weaken due to land interaction and the JMA downgraded the system back to a tropical storm."
