8,"At the same day, a Westerly wind burst occurred which resulted in formation of twin cyclones over the Indian Ocean."
9,the southern hemisphere counterpart being Tropical Cyclone Karim and the northern hemisphere counterpart being this cyclonic circulation.
10,The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) followed the suit and designated as Invest 92B on the next day.
11,"During 6 May, under the influence of the disturbance, a low pressure system formed off the coast of Andaman and Nicobar Islands."
12,"Subsequently, the JTWC issued its Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert(TCFA), as it had rapidly consolidated its convective structure for the past few hours, along with development a well-defined low-level centre."
13,"Late on 7 May, the system developed into a well-marked low pressure area over the same region."
14,"At 09:00 UTC, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and classified it as Tropical Cyclone 02B, while India Meteorological Department(IMD) simultaneously designated it as Depression BOB 03."
