15,"-Meteorological history-
A tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa on September 16."
16,A low level center of circulation developed from a tropical disturbance spawned by this tropical wave midway between the African coast and the Caribbean on September 20.
17,"The next day, the system gained sufficient organization to become a tropical depression."
18,"The depression moved westward in excess of 20 mph(32 km/h), and reached tropical storm strength-becoming Tropical Storm Lili as it passed through the Windward Islands."
19,"The cyclone continued to intensify as it moved west through the Caribbean Sea, reaching an initial peak strength of 70 mph(110 km/h) on the morning of September 24."
20,"This was immediately followed by an abrupt weakening, and the storm's maximum sustained winds dropped to 40 mph(64 km/h) later that day."
21,The sudden weakening was attributed to strong southerly vertical shear.
22,"The system degenerated into an open tropical wave the next morning, and remained in that state for nearly two days."

27,"The system turned to the northwest and sped up, becoming a major hurricane on October 2 while 365 miles(587 km) south-southeast of New Orleans."
28,"This intensification continued, aided by warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico and good outflow."

30,This strength was not maintained for long.
31,"The storm began to quickly weaken in the early morning hours of October 3, and this rapid weakening continued until the hurricane's final landfall near Intracoastal City, Louisiana, due to a combination of vertical wind shear, cool waters just offshore Louisiana, and slowly encroaching dry air within its southwest quadrant."
32,"By the time of landfall, maximum sustained winds had dropped to 90 mph(145 km/h)."
33,The weakening was accompanied by a collapse of the inner eyewall before landfall.
34,"The system continued inland, curving to the north-northeast, and dissipated when absorbed by an extratropical low near the Arkansas/Tennessee border on October 6."
35,"-Preparations-
